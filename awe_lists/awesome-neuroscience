     Curated list of awesome neuroscience libraries, software and any
     content related to the domain.

   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroscience]Neuroscience is the study
   of how the nervous system develops, its structure, and what it does.
   Neuroscientists focus on the brain and its impact on behavior and
   cognitive functions. Traditionally, neuroscience has been seen as a
   branch of biology, but it has grown to encompass a wide range of
   interdisciplinary fields that work together toward elucidating brain
   function at multiple levels of investigation.
