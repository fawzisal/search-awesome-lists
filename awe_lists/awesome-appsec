Why Invest in Application Security? (2015)

   Released: June 21, 2015

   Running a business requires being cost-conscious and minimizing
   unnecessary spending. The benefits of ensuring in the security of your
   application are invisible to most companies, so often times they
   neglect to invest in secure software development as a cost-saving
   measure. What these companies don't realize is the potential cost (both
   financial and to brand reputation) a preventable data compromise can
   incur.

   The average data breach costs millions of dollars in damage.

   Investing more time and personnel to develop secure software is, for
   most companies, worth it to minimize this unnecessary risk to their
   bottom line.
