Awesome

   A curated list of awesome radio resources. Inspired by awesome-*.

   I recently pulled out my CB radio and installed it in my truck. This
   inspired me to create an open source repository of all the radio
   related resources I found helpful and my notes on the subject.

   This project is aimed at hackers who enjoy all aspects of radio
   communication. While a lot of this technology isn't usable by citizens
   and is heavily regulated by the FCC, just knowing anything about it is
   special. I've been interested in learning the ins and outs of radio, as
   well as hearing stories, new and old.

CB

   Citizens band radio, or CB, is a two way radio spectrum dedicated to
   open use by anyone for almost any purpose. In the US and many other
   countries, it does not require a license to operate. CB consists of 40
   channels between 26.965 MHz and 27.405 MHz with channel 09 being
   dedicated to emergencies.

   CB is more popular among truckers and radio enthusiasts, but its
   usefulness does not stop there. It's great for long distance travel on
   popular trucking routes. You can tune to channel 19 (an unofficial
   trucker's channel) and get real time traffic updates, alternate routes
   and accident warnings.

   Given a good antenna that's properly tuned, a typical range to expect
   out of your CB is about 2 - 5 miles (3.2 - 8 kilometers).

General Use

   I've found a lot of my information on Jeep and trucker forums. From my
   own experience, it seems about half the CB transmission I hear include
   a handle of some kind. I also hear a lot of swearing, so I wouldn't
   sweat accidentally letting a "fuck" or a "shit" go.

   CB is public. Very public. That seems like a "no shit" kind of thing,
   but with the current generation pretty much only using cell phones,
   it's easy to forget that using something as "primitive" as a CB radio
   is essentially
   [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_band_radio#Working_skip]broadcas
   t to the world.

   Truckers tend to use channel 19. This is a good channel to monitor for
   traffic conditions.

   Channel 9 is for emergencies only. No general chatter on this channel.
   If you are broke down, or your car catches fire, besides calling 911,
   this is a good channel to transmit on for help.

   Around Portland, I hear a lot of chatter on channels 6, 17 and 28.
   These are good channels for entertaining conversation.

SWR

   [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_wave_ratio]SWR, or Standing Wave
   Ratio is a measurement of efficiency when connecting your antenna to
   your radio.

   Optimum ratio is 1:1, although you'll probably end up with 1.3:1 or so.
   Anything higher than 2:1 should be considered a no-no since it can
   damage your radio and give poor transmission. Read up on
   [http://www.rightchannelradios.com/tuning-cb-antenna-adjusting-swr]how
   to tune SWR.

Installing a mobile CB

   Installing your CB right is key to A) not damaging your radio hardware
   and B) getting good range and quality on both the receiving and
   transmitting ends.

   Following the advice in the following articles will ensure you have a
   quality setup.

SDR (Software Defined Radio)

   Software Defined Radio is a way to define components that are typically
   hardware, such as filters and amplifiers, as software. It has been
   around for a while, but with the cost of digital electronics needed to
   run SDR becoming increasingly cheaper, we are seeing a rise in hacker
   folk playing and building with SDR.

   I would like contributors for this section.

Hardware

     * Recommended starter hardware On the low end,
       [http://sdr.osmocom.org/trac/wiki/rtl-sdr]RTL-SDR is a super-cheap
       usb dongle, around which a thriving community has been founded.
     * On the other side of the cost spectrum,
       [http://www.pervices.com/]pervices makes some really
       high-throughput, PCIe devices for when you need to log all the
       traffic ever. The software and community support for this is less
       good, though (for which you can blame @outofculture).
     * You can also browse through the
       [https://gnuradio.org/redmine/projects/gnuradio/wiki/Hardware]big
       list of all compatible hardware.
     * Antennas are their own body of options and tradeoffs, about which I
       know nothing.

Software

   Depending on the hardware you're using, it may ship with some demo
   software to play around with. This is great for just getting a chance
   to see some waves and start to get an idea of what's possible.
   Otherwise, [https://gnuradio.org/redmine/]GNU Radio is going to where
   you'll spend your time. It's mainly just a library, but it also has a
   supporting gui for combining processing blocks that then outputs
   python. Once you're more comfortable, you can also just use GNURadio to
   do any device tuning, setup and i/o, and then use numpy for the signal
   manipulation math.

   Just visualizing and manually inspecting a signal is a valuable part of
   learning how to work with them. [http://www.baudline.com/]Baudline is a
   janky old thing, but it's the best there is. Be forewarned that
   learning the UI won't come easily to anyone.

Amateur Radio (a.k.a Ham Radio)

   The hobby of Amateur Radio has a long and proud tradition. The very
   first radio amateurs were true pioneers of radio technology. Amateurs
   'invented' and refined much of the early radio technology and were the
   first to transmit music, radio plays, and information to the handful of
   people who had the new fangled radio receivers.

   After World War II the hobby of amateur radio flourished. Radio clubs
   sprang up in schools all over the world and kids went home each night
   to build some new contraption, or have a chat with someone over the
   wireless. These young people became the mainstay of the technical
   professions and developed much of the modern technology we use today.

Public Health and Safety

   Police and fire in the United States typically communicate over trunked
   radio. This makes it hard to scan using normal reciever without trunk
   tracking abilities. See more in the
   [file://localhost/Users/admin/Pros/sh/awesome/awe_raw/awesome-radio#tru
   nking]trunking section.

Trunking

   While not strictly specific to public health and safety, it is usually
   the first thing that comes to mind when talking about trunked radio.

   Trunked radio is a form of digital-two-way communication where multiple
   organizations can share a small spectrum of real frequencies without
   hearing another organizations conversations. A user can choose a
   logical channel or group and the base station will find an empty
   frequency to transmit on.
