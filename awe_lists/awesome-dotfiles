Find dotfiles repos

   There are many great dotfiles repos out there, each containing their
   own inspiration and gems. I think one of the best ways to go through
   them is by
   [https://github.com/search?q=dotfiles&type=Repositories]searching
   GitHub for "dotfiles".

   Also see:
     * [https://www.google.nl/search?q=dotfiles]Google for "dotfiles"
     * [https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dotfiles]Archlinux collection
     * Tip: search for a filename on GitHub, e.g.
       [https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&type=Code&q=in%3Apath+.gi
       tconfig]in:path .gitconfig.
