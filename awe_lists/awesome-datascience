Motivation

   This part is for dummies who are new to Data Science

   This is a shortcut path to start studying Data Science. Just follow the
   steps to answer the questions, "What is Data Science and what should I
   study to learn Data Science?"

   First of all, Data Science is one of the hottest topics on the Computer
   and Internet farmland nowadays. People have gathered data from
   applications and systems until today and now is the time to analyze
   them. The next steps are producing suggestions from the data and
   creating predictions about the future.
   [https://www.quora.com/Data-Science/What-is-data-science]Here you can
   find the biggest question for Data Science and hundreds of answers from
   experts. Our favorite data scientist is
   [https://twitter.com/clarecorthell]Clare Corthell. She is an expert in
   data-related systems and a hacker, and has been working on a company as
   a data scientist. [http://datasciencemasters.org/]Clare's blog. This
   website helps you to understand the exact way to study as a
   professional data scientist.

   Secondly, Our favorite programming language is Python nowadays for
   #DataScience. Python's - [http://pandas.pydata.org/]Pandas library has
   full functionality for collecting and analyzing data. We use
   [https://www.continuum.io/downloads]Anaconda to play with data and to
   create applications.
