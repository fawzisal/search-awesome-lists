Foreword

   Falsehood articles are a form of commentary on a particular subject,
   and are appreciated by the developer community at large for their
   effectiveness and terseness. They're a convenient written form to
   approach an unfamiliar domain by dispelling myths, point out common
   pitfalls, show inconsistencies and subtleties.

   In a sense, Falsehood articles are a suite of wordy unit-tests covering
   extensive edge-cases provided by real-world usage.

Good Candidates

   Here is a non-restrictive list of items which are good candidates for
   inclusion in this awesome list.

Falsehood Articles

   Articles following the falsehood scheme are prime candidates for
   inclusion in this awesome list.

   These articles starts with the hypothesis that developers have a naive,
   simple view of the subject at hand. Then proceed to list a set of
   candid assumptions that might be held by such programmers. Each one is
   intentionally false, and sometimes illustrated by a counter-example.

   A list of falsehood is crafted as a progression that is designed to
   refine concepts. Having read the whole list of falsehood, the reader
   should possess a global, if not complete, overview of the domain being
   targeted by the article, including most, if not all, its pitfalls,
   edges-cases and inconsistencies.

   In the worst case, these articles might provoke an emotional reaction
   and cause flipping table. (¯°OS°)¯µ +=+

Libraries

   When possible, we provide a list of programming libraries or modules
   that may solve, or try to, the complexities and idiosyncrasies pointed
   by the falsehood articles above.

   So we can put back tables in place. +-+ No( 05-05No)

Data Structures

   Data models and structures generic enough to cover and address most of
   the falsehoods are also welcome in this page.
