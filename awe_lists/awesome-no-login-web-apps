   Curated list of awesome web apps that work without requesting you to
   create an account.

Inspiration

   To save the world from creating user accounts and installing software
   applications for every damn thing.

Some pointers

     * The web apps linked in this list provide most of their core
       features without login. Some websites that require registration
       have also been included in this list because of lack of a proper
       alternative. They have been tagged with [Account] in their listing.
     * Most of the apps mentioned here do provide some kind of a user
       account feature to save history and progress. But as already stated
       before, a user account is not necessary to use the main features of
       these apps.
