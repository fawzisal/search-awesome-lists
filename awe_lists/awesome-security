       interactive server side Industrial Control Systems honeypot
       designed to be easy to deploy, modify and extend. By providing a
       range of common industrial control protocols we created the basics
       to build your own system, capable to emulate complex
       infrastructures to convince an adversary that he just found a huge
       industrial complex. To improve the deceptive capabilities, we also
       provided the possibility to server a custom human machine interface
       to increase the honeypots attack surface. The response times of the
       services can be artificially delayed to mimic the behaviour of a
       system under constant load. Because we are providing complete
       stacks of the protocols, Conpot can be accessed with productive
       HMI's or extended with real hardware. Conpot is developed under the
       umbrella of the Honeynet Project and on the shoulders of a couple
       of very big giants.
     * [https://github.com/zeroq/amun]Amun - Amun Python-based

       NAT device with a DHCP server that is usually deployed with one NIC
       connected directly to the Internet and one NIC connected to the
       internal network. What differentiates Bifrozt from other standard
       NAT devices is its ability to work as a transparent SSHv2 proxy
       between an attacker and your honeypot. If you deployed an SSH
       server on Bifrozt's internal network it would log all the
       interaction to a TTY file in plain text that could be viewed later
       and capture a copy of any files that were downloaded. You would not
       have to install any additional software, compile any kernel modules
       or use a specific version or type of operating system on the
       internal SSH server for this to work. It will limit outbound
       traffic to a set number of ports and will start to drop outbound
       packets on these ports when certain limits are exceeded.
     * [http://bruteforce.gr/honeydrive]HoneyDrive - HoneyDrive is the
       premier honeypot Linux distro. It is a virtual appliance (OVA) with

Full Packet Capture / Forensic

     * [https://github.com/simsong/tcpflow]tcpflow - tcpflow is a program
       that captures data transmitted as part of TCP connections (flows),
       and stores the data in a way that is convenient for protocol
       analysis and debugging. Each TCP flow is stored in its own file.
       Thus, the typical TCP flow will be stored in two files, one for
       each direction. tcpflow can also process stored 'tcpdump' packet
       flows.
     * [http://www.xplico.org/]Xplico - The goal of Xplico is extract from
       an internet traffic capture the applications data contained. For
       example, from a pcap file Xplico extracts each email (POP, IMAP,
       and SMTP protocols), all HTTP contents, each VoIP call (SIP), FTP,
       TFTP, and so on. Xplico isn't a network protocol analyzer. Xplico
       is an open source Network Forensic Analysis Tool (NFAT).
     * [https://github.com/aol/moloch]Moloch - Moloch is an open source,
       large scale IPv4 packet capturing (PCAP), indexing and database
       system. A simple web interface is provided for PCAP browsing,
       searching, and exporting. APIs are exposed that allow PCAP data and
       JSON-formatted session data to be downloaded directly. Simple
       security is implemented by using HTTPS and HTTP digest password
       support or by using apache in front. Moloch is not meant to replace
       IDS engines but instead work along side them to store and index all
       the network traffic in standard PCAP format, providing fast access.
       Moloch is built to be deployed across many systems and can scale to
       handle multiple gigabits/sec of traffic.
