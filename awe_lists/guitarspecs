Electric Guitar Specifications

   This is a "top-down checklist" for the assembly of a solid-body
   electric guitar. It can help you to build a guitar with specific sound
   and playability characteristics.

   For example, for building a solid-body 'jazz-sounding' guitar you have
   to choose (top down by importance):
     * vintage or jazz pickup with convenient potentiometer and capacitor
       values
     * flatwound strings
     * massive neck, hollow body with wood such as mahagony

Guitar Necks

   [file://localhost/gitfrage/guitarspecs/blob/master/images/clip2_neck.jp
   g]Guitar Necks

   Neck thickness, neck width, neck contour and fret wire size affect
   playability and are a matter of personal taste. Important for good
   playability is balanced interaction of these components. Thicker neck
   often creates warmer tone.

Neck Nut Width and Nut Slot Spacing

   The real e1 to E6 string space can be controlled not only through nut
   width, but also by slot spacing in the nut. For example, 44.5 mm wide
   nut can have e1 to E6 distance between 35 and 37.5 mm.

Neck Heel Width and Mounting

   Most guitar parts manufacturer adopted Fender's® neck heel and neck
   pocket dimensions:
     * 56 mm (2-3/16") - Width
     * 76 mm (3") - Length
     * 16 mm (5/8") - Pocket Depth

   These dimensions are not a standard. Only careful measurement ensures
   that your parts will be compatible.

   Strat necks have a rounded base to their heel and Tele necks have a
   squared-off base to their heel, which makes it difficult to interchange
   the two types of necks across various bodies.

   [file://localhost/gitfrage/guitarspecs/blob/master/images/neck-heel-str
   at-vs-tele.jpg]neck-heel-strat-vs-tele

   Standard Fender heel mounting is done with 4-Bolt Holes - 1/8" (3mm)
   diameter (spread of 2" x 1-1/2").

Fretboard's Radius

   Smaller radius means a more rounded shape.
     * 7-1/4" - "Vintage" Fender®
     * 9-1/2" - "Modern" Fender®
     * 10" - Gibson®/PRS®
     * 12" - Ibanez®
     * 16" - Jackson®
     * compound (10" - 16") - Warmoth® and others

     * 6R - for left-handed
     * 3L/3R - "Gobson Stype"
     * 4L/2R - "Musicman Style"

Tuner Holes

     * approx. 8,7mm (11/32") - "Vintage Fender Style"
     * approx. 10mm (25/64" = 9,9mm) - "Sperzel Style",
     * approx. 10mm (13/32" = 10,3mm) - "Planet Waves Style"
     * approx. 10mm on top and 8,7mm bottom - "Schaller/Grover/Gotoh
       Slyle"

   Small holes can be enlarged with a sunk. Big holes can be retrofited by
   adapter bushings.

Guitar Bodies

   [file://localhost/gitfrage/guitarspecs/blob/master/images/clip1_body.jp
   g]Guitar Bodies

   The sound of electric guitar depends mainly on the vibration behavior
   of the string itself and the reproduction characteristics of the
   pickup. The vibration behavior of the string depends (very little) on
   wood. The body itself is very thick compared to the neck, that is why
   the body wood type and form have very limited influence on the sound of
   electric guitar.

   **Wide Humbucker (same as Seymourduncans "Trembucker" or Dimarzios
   "F-spaced Hambucker" can be used for guitars with larger sting distance
   with standard "Humbucker Routing"

     Seymourduncan.com says: "A quick and easy way to tell which you need
     is to measure from the middle of the high string to the middle of
     the low string, directly over the pickup. If the distance is greater
     than two inches or 50mm, go for a Trembucker. If it's less than two
     inches or 50mm, go for a humbucker."

       uner-holes]Tuner Holes)
     * Ratio - for 1x winding around the shaft head - 1x rotation
       necessary. Larger ratio (1:18 > 1:14) allows finer adjustments.
     * Standard vs Locking - with locking tuners strings are inserted
       through the axle bore and fixed by a screw from the outside

Bridges

   bridge

   Guitar bridge has large influence on playability (mainly through string
   spacing). Wider string spacing is better for finger-picking style,
   narrow spacing gives easier control when playing leads with distorted
   tone.
   [file://localhost/Users/admin/Pros/sh/awesome/awe_raw/guitarspecs#bridg
   e-routing]Bridge Routing chapter above describes common bridge
   categories with string spacing specification.

   Bridge form and material have also some influence on sound. Good
   manufacturers provide detailed product information on their pages:

     [https://abm-guitarpartsshop.com/From-a-solid-Block-to-a-Bridge:_:20
     6.html]ABM - indicates that Bell Brass and Steel shape the guitar
     sound with character, while Aluminum acts largely neutral in the
     transfer of tone.

Electronics

   electronics

   Electronics exerts greatest influence on the overall sound of a
   solid-body electric guitar.

     [http://www.buildyourguitar.com/resources/lemme/index.htm]buildyourg
     uitar.com - The Secrets of Electric Guitar Pickups by Lemme - "If
     you know the resonant frequency and height of the resonant peak, you
     know about 90 percent of a pickup's transfer characteristics. Some
     other effects cannot be described using this model, but their
     influence is less important".

   Frequency response of a magnetic pickup may look like this
   resonant peak and frequency
   Sound group Resonant frequency  Resonant peak      Example Pickup
   bright      3 - 6kHz           high peak        Fender single coils
   powerful    2 - 3kHz           medium high peak Gibson PAF
   mellow      1.5 - 2kHz         low peak         Rolling back tone pot

   Following topics change resonant frequency and resonant peak:
     * Pickup Properties - position and height of
       frequency peak vary from type to type.
     * [file://localhost/Users/admin/Pros/sh/awesome/awe_raw/guitarspecs#e
       lectronics-wiring-options]Electronics Wiring Options - Hambucker
       coils are switched in series by default, switching them in parallel
       or using only one of the coils will increase resonant frequency and
       the sound will have more treble.
     * Potentiometer and Capacitor
       Values changing provides also simple way to change resonant
       frequency and peak.
     * Cable capacitance - longer cable will lead to lower resonant

     * Wiring: 1, 2, 3 or 4-Conductor (4-Conductor allowing most flexible
       wiring)*
     * Position: Bridge, Neck, Middle
     * Passive vs. Active (Active often used for distortion sound)
     * D.C. Resistance: indication how much output a pickup will have

Active Pickups Electronics

   active pickups

   Active Electronics tries to reduce dependancy from the shielded cable
   and amp input impedance. However, that needs power to operate, and
   that's its biggest drawback.

Strings

   trings

   Depending on following options your sound will be more bright or more
   mellow:
     * Construction (Flat Wound/Round Wound)
     * Material (Steel/Nickel) and
     * Tension

   Most manufacturers use following naming convention to describe tension
   of string set:
      Name     'e' site approx. 'E' site approx.
   Extra-Light .008             .039
   Light       .009             .042

   Jazz        .012             .054
   Baritone    .013             .056

   There are also other hybrid sets available - like "Light Top/Heavy
   Bottom" and "Balanced Tension" combinations.

Scale Length

   scale-length

   A guitar's scale length is length of string between the nut and the
   bridge.

   Scale has a relatively low impact on sound and playability of the
   guitar. (Compared with other parameters such as strings or pickups).

   Longer scale length sound and playability characteristics:
     * quick response, crisp attack
     * transparent sound with well-defined basses and heights
     * larger finger spread
     * higher string tension at constant gauge

   Shorter scale length sound characteristics:
     * warmer
     * more sustain and longer decay

   Common Scale Length:
     * 572 mm (22.5") or shorter - 3/4 & some travel guitars
     * 596,9 mm (23.50") - Fender Jazzmaster/Jaguar guitars
     * 629 mm (24.75") - many Gibson guitars
     * 635 mm (25") - many PRS guitars
     * 648 mm (25.5") - many Fender guitars
     * 650 mm (25.5) - typical classical guitars
     * 686 mm (27") or longer - Baritone guitars

   instruments and NOT for solid body guitars, where other components have
   much larger impact on sound. Thus, a mahogany electric guitar can sound
   bright despite the representations below. ² Weight may vary for the
   same variety. ³ Used for: T - Body Top | B - Body | N - neck | F -
