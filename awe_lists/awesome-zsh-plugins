Frameworks

   These frameworks make customizing your zsh setup easier.

alf

   Alf is an out of this world super fast and configurable framework for
   ZSH; it's modeled after Prezto and Antigen while utilizing Oh-My-Zsh
   under the covers; and offers standard defaults, aliases, functions,
   auto completion, automated updates and installable prompt themes and
   plugins.

ansible-role-zsh

   ansible-role-zsh is an ansible role with zero-knowledge installation.
   It uses antigen to manage bundles and oh-my-zsh. Can load bundles
   conditionally. By default it includes powerlevel9k theme,
   autosuggestions, syntax-highlighting and fzf-widgets. Fully
   customizable.

ant-zsh

   Ant-zsh is a tiny and lightweight ZSH configuration environment for
   special customization needs. It includes plugins, themes and a basic
   convenient setup.

antibody

   Antibody A faster and simpler antigen written in Golang. More details
   at [http://getantibody.github.io/]http://getantibody.github.io/.

antigen-hs

   antigen-hs is a replacement for antigen optimized for a low overhead
   when starting up the shell. It will automatically clone plugins for
   you.

antigen

   Antigen is a small set of functions that help you easily manage your
   shell (ZSH) plugins, called bundles. The concept is pretty much the
   same as bundles in a typical vim+pathogen setup. Antigen is to ZSH,
   what Vundle is to vim. Antigen can load oh-my-zsh themes and plugins
   and will automatically clone them for you.

ax-zsh

   Ax-ZSH is a modular configuration system for ZSH. It provides sane
   defaults and is extendable by plugins.

dotzsh

   Dotzsh strives to be platform and version independent. Some
   functionality may be lost when running under older versions of ZSH, but
   it should degrade cleanly and allow you to use the same setup on
   multiple machines of differing OSes without problems.

fresh

   fresh is a tool to source shell configuration (aliases, functions, etc)
   from others into your own configuration files. We also support files
   such as ackrc and gitconfig. Think of it as Bundler for your dot files.

oh-my-zsh

   oh-my-zsh is a community-driven framework for managing your ZSH
   configuration. Includes 120+ optional plugins (rails, git, macOS, hub,
   capistrano, brew, ant, macports, etc), over 120 themes to spice up your
   morning, and an auto-update tool that makes it easy to keep up with the
   latest updates from the community.

prezto

   Prezto enriches the ZSH command line interface environment with sane
   defaults, aliases, functions, auto completion, and prompt themes.

pumice

   Pumice is a lightweight plugin manager for ZSH.

Toasty

   Toasty is a ZSH framework made to facilitate management, not dictate
   it.

zeesh

   Zeesh is a cross-platform ZSH framework. It's similar to, but
   incompatible with, oh-my-zsh. It has a modular plugin architecture
   making it easy to extend. It has a rich set of defaults, but is
   designed to be as lightweight as possible.

zgen

   Zgen is a lightweight plugin manager for ZSH inspired by Antigen. The
   goal is to have a minimal overhead when starting up the shell because
   nobody likes waiting. The script generates a static init.zsh file which
   does nothing but source your plugins and append them to your fpath. The
   downside is that you have to refresh the init script manually with zgen
   reset whenever you update your .zshrc. Can load oh-my-zsh compatible
   plugins and themes, and will automagically clone them for you when you
   add them to your plugin list.

zilsh

   zilsh is a ZSH config system that aims to appeal more to power-users
   and follow the simplistic approach of vim-pathogen.

zim

   Zim is a ZSH configuration framework with blazing speed and modular
   extensions.

zit

   zit is a plugin manager for ZSH. It is minimal because it implements
   the bare minimum to be qualified as a plugin manager: it allows the
   user to install plugins from Git repositories (and Git repositories
   only, them why the name), source plugins and update them. It does not
   implement fancy functions like cleanup of removed plugins, automatic
   compilation of installed plugins, alias for oh-my-zsh/prezto/other ZSH
   frameworks, building binaries, PATH manipulation and others.

zoppo

   Zoppo is the crippled configuration framework for ZSH. As an Italian
   saying goes: "chi va con lo zoppo, impara a zoppicare", we realized we
   were walking with a cripple and are now going to become crippled
   ourselves.

zpacker

   Zpacker is a lightweight ZSH plugin & theme management framework.

zplug

   º Zplug is a next-generation ZSH plugin manager.

zplugin

   Zplugin is an innovative plugin manager with
   [https://github.com/zdharma/zplugin-crasis]semigraphical UI,
   [https://github.com/zdharma/zplugin#turbo-mode]Turbo Mode and
   [https://github.com/zservices]services support.

ZPM

   ZPM ( ZSH Plugin Manager ) is a plugin manager for
   [http://www.zsh.org/]ZSH similar to vim-plug. ZPM plugins are
   compatible with [https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh]oh-my-zsh.
   ZPM runs on Linux, Android, FreeBSD and macOS.

ZR

   ZR is a ZSH plugin manager written in Rust.

ztanesh

   Ztanesh aims to improve your UNIX command line experience and
   productivity with the the configuration provided by the ztanesh
   project: the tools will make your shell more powerful and easier to
   use.

zulu

   Zulu is a total environment manager for ZSH 5+

Installation

Antigen

   Most of these plugins can be installed by adding antigen bundle
   githubuser/reponame to your .zshrc file. Antigen will handle cloning
   the plugin for you automatically the next time you start zsh. You can
   also add the plugin to a running ZSH with antigen bundle
   githubuser/reponame for testing before adding it to your .zshrc.

dotzsh

    1. Clone new plugins into .zsh.local/modules
    2. Load the plugin module in .zshrc
    3. Open a new ZSH terminal window or tab

Oh-My-Zsh

    1. cd ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins
    2. git clone repo
    3. Add the repo to your plugin list

Prezto

    1. Clone the plugin into your prezto modules directory
    2. Add the plugin to your .zpreztorc file
    3. Open a new terminal window or tab

Zgen

   Most of these plugins can be installed by adding zgen load
   githubuser/reponame to your .zshrc file in the same function you're
   doing your other zgen load calls in. Zgen will automatically clone the
   repositories for you when you do a zgen save.

zplug

   Most of these plugins can be installed by adding zplug
   "githubuser/reponame" to your .zshrc file.
