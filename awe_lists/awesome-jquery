   A curated list of awesome [http://jquery.com/]jQuery plugins, resources
   and other shiny things. Inspired by the awesome-* trend on GitHub.

     [http://jquery.com/]jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich
     [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript]JavaScript
     library. It makes things like HTML document traversal and
     manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with
     an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers. With a
     combination of versatility and extensibility, jQuery has changed the
     way that millions of people write JavaScript.
