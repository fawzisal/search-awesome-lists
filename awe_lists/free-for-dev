README.md

free-for-dev

   Developers and Open Source authors now have a massive amount of
   services offering free tiers, but it can be hard to find them all in
   order to make informed decisions.

   This is a list of software (SaaS, PaaS, IaaS, etc.) and other offerings
   that have free tiers for developers.

   The scope of this particular list is limited to things infrastructure
   developers (System Administrator, DevOps Practitioners, etc.) are
   likely to find useful. We love all the free services out there, but it
   would be good to keep it on topic. It's a bit of a grey line at times
   so this is a bit opinionated; do not be offended if I do not accept
   your contribution.

   You can help by sending Pull Requests to add more services. Once I have
   a good set of links in this README file, I'll look into a better layout
   for the information and links (help with that is appreciated too).

   NOTE: This list is only for as-a-Service offerings, not for self-hosted
   software. For a service to be eligible it has to offer a Free Tier and
   not just a free trial. If the Free Tier is time bucketed it has to be
   at least a year.
