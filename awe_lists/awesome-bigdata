Key Map Data Model

   Note: There is some term confusion in the industry, and two different
   things are called "Columnar Databases". Some, listed here, are
   distributed, persistent databases built around the "key-map" data
   model: all data has a (possibly composite) key, with which a map of
   key-value pairs is associated. In some systems, multiple such value
   maps can be associated with a key, and these maps are referred to as
   "column families" (with value map keys being referred to as "columns").

   Another group of technologies that can also be called "columnar
   databases" is distinguished by how it stores data, on disk or in memory
   -- rather than storing data the traditional way, where all column
   values for a given key are stored next to each other, "row by row",
   these systems store all column values next to each other. So more work
   is needed to get all columns for a given key, but less work is needed
   to get all values for a given column.

   The former group is referred to as "key map data model" here. The line
   between these and the
   [file://localhost/Users/admin/Pros/sh/awesome/awe_raw/awesome-bigdata#k
   ey-value-data-model]Key-value Data Model stores is fairly blurry.

   The latter, being more about the storage format than about the data
   model, is listed under
   Columnar Databases.

   You can read more about this distinction on Prof. Daniel Abadi's blog:
