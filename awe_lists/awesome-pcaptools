     * Bmon: (Bandwidth Monitor) is a tool similar to nload that shows the
       traffic load over all the network interfaces on the system. The
       output also consists of a graph and a section with packet level
       details.
       [Screenshot]([http://www.binarytides.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/20

     * Bwm-ng: (Bandwidth Monitor Next Generation) is another very simple
       real time network load monitor that reports a summary of the speed
       at which data is being transferred in and out of all available
       network interfaces on the system.

     * CBM: (Color Bandwidth Meter) A tiny little simple bandwidth monitor
       that displays the traffic volume through network interfaces. No
       further options, just the traffic stats are display and updated in
       realtime.
       [Screenshot]([http://www.binarytides.com/blog]http://www.binarytide
       s.com/blog /wp-content/uploads/2014/03/cbm.png)
     * Collectl: reports system statistics in a style that is similar to
       dstat, and like dstat it is gathers statistics about various
       different system resources like cpu, memory, network etc. Over here
       is a simple example of how to use it to report network
       usage/bandwidth.

     * Dstat: is a versatile tool (written in python) that can monitor
       different system statistics and report them in a batch style mode
       or log the data to a csv or similar file. This example shows how to
       use dstat to report network bandwidth
       Screensh
       ot
     * Ifstat: reports the network bandwidth in a batch style mode. The
       output is in a format that is easy to log and parse using other
       programs or utilities.

     * Iftop: measures the data flowing through individual socket
       connections, and it works in a manner that is different from Nload.
       Iftop uses the pcap library to capture the packets moving in and
       out of the network adapter, and then sums up the size and count to
       find the total bandwidth under use. Although iftop reports the
       bandwidth used by individual connections, it cannot report the
       process name/id involved in the particular socket connection. But
       being based on the pcap library, iftop is able to filter the
       traffic and report bandwidth usage over selected host connections
       as specified by the filter.

     * Iptraf: is an interactive and colorful IP Lan monitor. It shows
       individual connections and the amount of data flowing between the
       hosts.

     * Jnettop: [http://jnettop.kubs.info/wiki/]Jnettop is a traffic
       visualiser, which captures traffic going through the host it is
       running from and displays streams sorted by bandwidth they use.

     * Nethogs: is a small 'net top' tool that shows the bandwidth used by
       individual processes and sorts the list putting the most intensive
       processes on top. In the event of a sudden bandwidth spike, quickly
       open nethogs and find the process responsible. Nethogs reports the
       PID, user and the path of the program.
       [http://www.binarytides.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/nethogs

     * Netload: displays a small report on the current traffic load, and
       the total number of bytes transferred since the program start. No
       more features are there. Its part of the netdiag.
       [http://www.binarytides.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/netload
       .png]Screenshot
     * Netwatch: is part of the netdiag collection of tools, and it too
       displays the connections between local host and other remote hosts,
       and the speed at which data is transferring on each connection.

     * Nload: is a commandline tool that allows users to monitor the
       incoming and outgoing traffic separately. It also draws outa graph
       to indicate the same, the scale of which can be adjusted. Easy and
       simple to use, and does not support many options.
       [http://www.binarytides.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/nload.p
       ng]Screenshot
     * Pktstat: displays all the active connections in real time, and the
       speed at which data is being transferred through them. It also
       displays the type of the connection, i.e. tcp or udp and also
       details about http requests if involved.
       [http://www.binarytides.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/pktstat
       .png]Screenshot
     * Slurm: is 'yet' another network load monitor that shows device
       statistics along with an ascii graph. It supports 3 different
       styles of graphs each of which can be activated using the c, s and
       l keys. Simple in features, slurm does not display any further
       details about the network load.

     * Speedometer: Another small and simple tool that just draws out good
       looking graphs of incoming and outgoing traffic through a given
       interface.

     * Tcptrack: is similar to iftop, and uses the pcap library to capture
       packets and calculate various statistics like the bandwidth used in
       each connection. It also supports the standard pcap filters that
       can be used to monitor specific connections.
       [Screenshot]([http://www.binarytides.com/blog]http://www.binarytide
       s.com/blog /wp-content/uploads/2014/03/tcptrack.png)
     * Trafshow: reports the current active connections, their protocol
       and the data transfer speed on each connection. It can filter out
       connections using pcap type filters.
       [http://www.binarytides.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/trafsho
       w.png]Screenshot
     * Vnstat: is bit different from most of the other tools. It actually
       runs a background service/daemon and keeps recording the size of
       data transfer all the time. Next it can be used to generate a
       report of the history of network usage.

Traffic Capture

     * [http://www.tcpdump.org/]Libpcap/Tcpdump: The official site of
       tcpdump, a powerful command-line packet analyzer; and libpcap, a
       portable C/C++ library for network traffic capture.
     * [http://ngrep.sourceforge.net/]Ngrep: strives to provide most of
       GNU grep's common features, applying them to the network layer.
       ngrep is a pcap-aware tool that will allow you to specify extended
       regular or hexadecimal expressions to match against data payloads
       of packets. It currently recognizes TCP, UDP and ICMP across
       Ethernet, PPP, SLIP, FDDI, Token Ring and null interfaces, and
       understands bpf filter logic in the same fashion as more common
       packet sniffing tools, such as tcpdump and snoop.
     * [https://github.com/ruedigergad/clj-net-pcap]clj-net-pcap:
       clj-net-pcap is a packet capturing library for Clojure.
       clj-net-pcap uses jNetPcap and adds convenience functionality
       around jNetPcap for easing the usability. A
       [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=690
       3107]paper on clj-net-pcap was published in scope of COMPSACW 2014.
     * [http://jnetpcap.com/]jNetPcap: jNetPcap is a packet capturing
       library for Java that is available for Linux and Windows. jNetPcap
       leverages libpcap respectively WinPcap and employs the Java Native
       Interface (JNI) for using the functionality provided by
       libpcap/WinPcap.
     * [https://github.com/aol/moloch]Moloch: Moloch is a open source
       large scale full PCAP capturing, indexing and database system.

       can capture full- sized network packets at multi-Gigabit rate
       (above 10 Gigabit/s on adequate hardware) from a live network
       interface, and write them into files without any packet loss.
     * [http://www.openfpc.org/]OpenFPC: OpenFPC is a set of scripts that
       combine to provide a lightweight full-packet network traffic
       recorder & buffering tool. Its design goal is to allow non-expert
       users to deploy a distributed network traffic recorder on COTS
       hardware while integrating into existing alert and log tools.
     * [http://www.ntop.org/products/pf_ring/]PF_RING: PF_RING is a new
       type of network socket that dramatically improves the packet
       capture speed. Available for Linux kernels 2.6.32 and newer. No
       need to patch the kernel. PF_RING-aware drivers for increased
       packet capture acceleration.
     * [http://www.csl.sony.co.jp/person/kjc/kjc/software.html#ttt]TTT:
       (Tele Traffic Tapper) is yet another descendant of tcpdump but it
       is capable of real-time, graphical, and remote traffic-monitoring.
       ttt won't replace tcpdump, rather, it helps you find out what to
       look into with tcpdump. ttt monitors the network and automatically
       picks up the main contributors of the traffic within the time
       window. The graphs are updated every second by default.
     * [https://tools.netsa.cert.org/yaf/yaf.html]Yaf: It's a reliable
       piece of software, quite solid and able to generate flow records
       from pcap. This is very nice for indexing huge pcap or even doing
       packet capture. The recent version can even extract payloads and
       put in the flow records.

Traffic Analysis/Inspection

     * [https://bitbucket.org/camp0/aiengine]AIEngine: is a next
       generation interactive/programmable packet inspection engine with
       capabilities of learning without any human intervention, NIDS
       functionality, DNS domain classification, network collector and
       many others. AIEngine also helps network/security professionals to
       identify traffic and develop signatures for use them on NIDS,
       Firewalls, Traffic classifiers and so on.
     * [http://bro-ids.org/]Bro: is an open-source, Unix-based Network
       Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) that passively monitors network
       traffic and looks for suspicious activity. Bro detects intrusions
       by first parsing network traffic to extract its application- level
       semantics and then executing event-oriented analyzers that compare
       the activity with patterns deemed troublesome. Its analysis
       includes detection of specific attacks (including those defined by
       signatures, but also those defined in terms of events) and unusual
       activities (e.g., certain hosts connecting to certain services, or
       patterns of failed connection attempts).

       is a distributed network sniffer with a web front- end. Ecap was
       written many years ago in 2005, but a post on the tcpdump-workers
       mailing list requested a similar application... so here it is. It
       would be fun to update it and work on it again if there's any
       interest.
     * [http://etherape.sourceforge.net/]EtherApe: is a graphical network
       monitor for Unix modeled after etherman. Featuring link layer, ip
       and TCP modes, it displays network activity graphically. Hosts and
       links change in size with traffic. Color coded protocols display.
       It supports Ethernet, FDDI, Token Ring, ISDN, PPP and SLIP devices.
       It can filter traffic to be shown, and can read traffic from a file
       as well as live from the network.

       summarizes TCP/IP dump files into a self-describing ASCII format
       easily readable by humans and programs. Ipsumdump can read packets
       from network interfaces, from tcpdump files, and from existing
       ipsumdump files. It will transparently uncompress tcpdump or
       ipsumdump files when necessary. It can randomly sample traffic,
       filter traffic based on its contents, anonymize IP addresses, and
       sort packets from multiple dumps by timestamp. Also, it can
       optionally create a tcpdump file containing actual packet data.
       It's also convenient to work with CLICK as a inserted module.
     * [http://ita.ee.lbl.gov/]ITA: The Internet Traffic Archive is a
       moderated repository to support widespread access to traces of
       Internet network traffic, sponsored by ACM SIGCOMM. The traces can
       be used to study network dynamics, usage characteristics, and
       growth patterns, as well as providing the grist for trace- driven
       simulations. The archive is also open to programs for reducing raw
       trace data to more manageable forms, for generating synthetic
       traces, and for analyzing traces.
     * [http://code.google.com/p/libcrafter/]Libcrafter: is a high level
       library for C++ designed to make easier the creation and decoding
       of network packets. It is able to craft or decode packets of most
       common network protocols, send them on the wire, capture them and
       match requests and replies.
     * [http://libnet.sourceforge.net/]Libnet: is a collection of routines
       to help with the construction and handling of network packets. It
       provides a portable framework for low-level network packet shaping,
       handling and injection. Libnet features portable packet creation
       interfaces at the IP layer and link layer, as well as a host of
       supplementary and complementary functionality. Using libnet, quick
       and simple packet assembly applications can be whipped up with
       little effort.
     * [http://libnids.sourceforge.net/]Libnids: designed by Rafal
       Wojtczuk, is an implementation of an E-component of Network
       Intrusion Detection System. It emulates the IP stack of Linux
       2.0.x. Libnids offers IP defragmentation, TCP stream assembly and
       TCP port scan detection. The most valuable feature of libnids is
       reliability. A number of tests were conducted, which proved that
       libnids predicts behaviour of protected Linux hosts as closely as
       possible.
     * [http://www.vanheusden.com/multitail]Multitail: now has a
       colorscheme included for monitoring the tcpdump output. It can also
       filter, convert timestamps to timestrings and much more.

     * [http://www.netexpect.org/]Network Expect: is a framework that
       allows to easily build tools that can interact with network
       traffic. Following a script, traffic can be injected into the
       network, and decisions can be taken, and acted upon, based on
       received network traffic. An interpreted language provides
       branching and high-level control structures to direct the
       interaction with the network. Network Expect uses libpcap for
       packet capture and libwireshark (from the Wireshark project) for
       packet dissection tasks. (GPL, BSD/Linux/OSX).
     * [http://www.ntop.org/]Ntop: Ntop is a network traffic probe that
       shows the network usage, similar to what the popular top Unix
       command does. ntop is based on libpcap and it has been written in a
       portable way in order to virtually run on every Unix platform and
       on Win32 as well.
     * [http://www.ntop.org/products/ntop/]Ntopng: Ntopng is the next

       to classify packets into flows. It's so simple that only one task
       is aimed to finish. For Deep Packet Inspection or flow
       classification, it's so common to analyze the feature of one
       specific flow. I have make the attempt to use made-ready tools like
       tcpflows, tcpslice, tcpsplit, but all these tools try to either
       decrease the trace volume (under requirement) or resemble the
       packets into flow payloads (over requirement). I have not found a
       simple tool to classify the packets into flows without further
       processing.

       tshark, allowing python packet parsing using wireshark dissectors.
       There are quite a few python packet parsing modules, this one is
       different because it doesn't actually parse any packets, it simply

     * [http://www.secdev.org/projects/scapy/]Scapy: Scapy is a powerful
       interactive packet manipulation program. It is able to forge or
       decode packets of a wide number of protocols, send them on the
       wire, capture them, match requests and replies, and much more. It
       can easily handle most classical tasks like scanning, tracerouting,
       probing, unit tests, attacks or network discovery (it can replace
       hping, 85% of nmap, arpspoof, arp-sk, arping, tcpdump, tethereal,
       p0f, etc.). It also performs very well at a lot of other specific
       tasks that most other tools can't handle, like sending invalid
       frames, injecting your own 802.11 frames, combining technics (VLAN
       hopping+ARP cache poisoning, VOIP decoding on WEP encrypted
       channel, ...), etc.

     * [http://ita.ee.lbl.gov/html/contrib/tcp-reduce.html]TCP-Reduce:
       TCP-Reduce is a collection of Bourne shell scripts for reducing
       tcpdump traces to one-line summaries of each TCP connection present
       in the trace. The scripts look only at TCP SYN/FIN/RST packets.
       Connections without SYN packets in the trace (such as those on-
       going at the beginning of the trace) will not appear in the
       summary. Garbaged packets (those missing some of their contents)
       are reported to stderr as bogon's and are discarded. Occasionally
       the script gets fooled by retransmissions with altered sequence
       numbers, and reports erroneous huge connection sizes - always check
       large connections (say 100 MB or more) for plausibility.

       Tcpdpriv is program for eliminating confidential information (user
       data and addresses) from packets collected on a network interface
       (or, from trace files created using the -w argument to tcpdump).
       Tcpdpriv removes the payload of TCP and UDP, and the entire IP
       payload for other protocols. It implements several address
       scrambling methods; the sequential numbering method and its
       variants, and a hash method with preserving address prefix.

       captures data transmitted as part of TCP connections (flows), and
       stores the data in a way that is convenient for protocol analysis
       or debugging. A program like 'tcpdump' shows a summary of packets
       seen on the wire, but usually doesn't store the data that's
       actually being transmitted. In contrast, tcpflow reconstructs the
       actual data streams and stores each flow in a separate file for
       later analysis.
