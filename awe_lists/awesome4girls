       Given the still small number of women speaking at events
       (especially technology) here in Brazil, a spreadsheet was created

       talk about themes related to programming, design, entrepreneurship
       and technology in general, this project was born from trying to
       organize the data of the worksheet in a more visual, facilitating
       access, reducing duplication and facilitating research.
