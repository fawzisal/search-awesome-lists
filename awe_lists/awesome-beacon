Physical Web

     The Physical Web is an approach to unleash the core superpower of
     the web: interaction on demand. People should be able to walk up to
     any smart device - a vending machine, a poster, a toy, a bus stop, a
     rental car - and not have to download an app first. Everything
     should be just a tap away.
