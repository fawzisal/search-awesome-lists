$ git reset --hard <commit>

Reset your HEAD pointer to a remote branch current state.

$ git reset --hard <remote/branch> e.g., upstream/master, origin/my-feature

Reset your HEAD pointer to a previous commit and preserve all changes as unstaged changes:

$ git reset <commit>

Reset your HEAD pointer to a previous commit and preserve uncommitted local changes:

     __________________________________________________________________

Setup

You need a working git installation as prerequisite. Git flow works on OSX, Linux and Windows.

OSX Homebrew:

$ brew install git-flow-avh

OSX Macports:

$ port install git-flow

Linux (Debian-based):

$ sudo apt-get install git-flow

Windows (Cygwin):

You need wget and util-linux to install git-flow.

$ wget -q -O - --no-check-certificate https://raw.githubusercontent.com/petervanderdoes/gitflow/develop/contrib/gitflow-installer.sh install <state> | bash
     __________________________________________________________________

Getting Started

Git flow needs to be initialized in order to customize your project setup. Start using git-flow by initializing it inside an existing git repository:

Initialize:

You'll have to answer a few questions regarding the naming conventions for your branches. It's recommended to use the default values.

git flow init

   OR

To use default

git flow init -d
     __________________________________________________________________

Features

Develop new features for upcoming releases. Typically exist in developers repos only.

Start a new feature:

This action creates a new feature branch based on 'develop' and switches to it.

git flow feature start MYFEATURE

Finish up a feature:

Finish the development of a feature. This action performs the following:

1) Merged MYFEATURE into 'develop'.

2) Removes the feature branch.

3) Switches back to 'develop' branch

git flow feature finish MYFEATURE

Publish a feature:

Are you developing a feature in collaboration? Publish a feature to the remote server so it can be used by other users.

git flow feature publish MYFEATURE

Getting a published feature:

Get a feature published by another user.

git flow feature pull origin MYFEATURE

Tracking a origin feature:

You can track a feature on origin by using

git flow feature track MYFEATURE
     __________________________________________________________________

Make a Release

Support preparation of a new production release. Allow for minor bug fixes and preparing meta-data for a release

Start a release:

 commit sha-1 hash to start the release from. The commit must be on the 'develop' branch.

git flow release start RELEASE [BASE]

It's wise to publish the release branch after creating it to allow release commits by other developers. Do it similar to feature publishing with the command:

git flow release publish RELEASE

(You can track a remote release with the: git flow release track RELEASE command)

Finish up a release:

Finishing a release is one of the big steps in git branching. It performs several actions:

1) Merges the release branch back into 'master'

2) Tags the release with its name

3) Back-merges the release into 'develop'

4) Removes the release branch

git flow release finish RELEASE

Don't forget to push your tags with git push --tags
     __________________________________________________________________

Hotfixes

Hotfixes arise from the necessity to act immediately upon an undesired state of a live production version. May be branched off from the corresponding tag on the master branch that marks the production version.

Git flow hotfix start:

Like the other git flow commands, a hotfix is started with

$ git flow hotfix start VERSION [BASENAME]

The version argument hereby marks the new hotfix release name. Optionally you can specify a basename to start from.

Finish a hotfix:

By finishing a hotfix it gets merged back into develop and master. Additionally the master merge is tagged with the hotfix version

git flow hotfix finish VERSION
