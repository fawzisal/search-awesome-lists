iTunes

Keyboard Media Keys

   This works up to Yosemite. System Integrity Protection was introduced
   in El Capitan which prevents system Launch Agents from being unloaded.
# Stop Responding to Key Presses
launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.rcd.plist

# Respond to Key Presses (Default)
launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.rcd.plist

   From El Capitan onwards, you can either disable SIP or resort to a kind
   of hack, which will make iTunes inaccessible to any user, effectively
   preventing it from starting itself or its helpers. Be aware that for
   all intents and purposes this will trash your iTunes installation and

Vacuum Mail Index

   The AppleScript code below will quit Mail, vacuum the SQLite index,
   then re-open Mail. On a large email database that hasn't been optimized
   for a while, this can provide significant improvements in
   responsiveness and speed.

Time Machine

Change Backup Interval

   This changes the interval to 30 minutes. The integer value is the time
   in seconds.
sudo defaults write /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.backupd-auto StartInterval -int 1800

Local Backups

   Whether Time Machine performs local backups while the Time Machine
   backup volume is not available.
# Status
defaults read /Library/Preferences/com.apple.TimeMachine MobileBackups

# Enable (Default)
sudo tmutil enablelocal

# Disable
sudo tmutil disablelocal

   Since High Sierra, you cannot disable local snapshots. Time Machine now
   always creates a local APFS snapshot and uses that snapshot as the data
   source to create a regular backup, rather than using the live disk as
   the source, as is the case with HFS formatted disks.

Prevent Time Machine from Prompting to Use New Hard Drives as Backup Volume

sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.TimeMachine DoNotOfferNewDisksForBackup -bool true

   This little script will output the last 12 hours of Time Machine
   activity followed by live activity.

# show the last 12 hours

   into snapshots. Checksums are not retroactively computed for files that
   were copied by earlier releases of OS X.

     With an SSD drive, Secure Erase and Erasing Free Space are not

     from an SSD.
