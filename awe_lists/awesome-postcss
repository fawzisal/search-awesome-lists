   Awesome PostCSS

   [https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome]Awesome
   [https://travis-ci.org/jjaderg/awesome-postcss]Build Status

     An selected list of PostCSS resources and other things related.

   PostCSS is not a preprocessor; it doesn't transform CSS. As a matter of
   fact, it doesn't do much by itself at all. What it does is provide a
   CSS parser and a framework for creating plugins that can analyse, lint,
   handle assets, optimise, create fallbacks, and otherwise transform
   parsed CSS. PostCSS parses CSS into an abstract syntax tree
   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree]AST, passes it
   through a series of plugins, and then concatenates back into a string.

   Your contributions are always welcome. But, please take a quick gander
   at the contribution
   [https://github.com/jjaderg/awesome-postcss/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md
   ]guidelines first.
