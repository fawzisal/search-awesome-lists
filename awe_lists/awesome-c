Awesome

   A curated list of C good stuff. This list contains only
   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software]free software for code,
   and sellers who aren't evil for physical resources.

   LOOKING FOR MAINTAINERS: This list is currently pretty much inactive.
   I'm looking for maintainers that can make it great again. See
   [https://github.com/aleksandar-todorovic/awesome-c/issues/26]#26 for
   more info, but the process is simple: add or fix a couple of things in
   this list and you'll become a contributor to a 850+ stars list.

   This list was previously maintained by
   [https://github.com/kozross]@kozross. He decided to switch the list to
   a [https://notabug.org/koz.ross/awesome-c]new platform, so I've decided
   to fork it so we could keep it on GitHub.
