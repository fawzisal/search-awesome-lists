   ## Currently Supported Platforms
     * GNU/Linux
     * Darwin/OS X
     * FreeBSD
     * Windows

   All systems are supported with both x86/64 (64-bit) and x86 (32-bit)
   architectures. Experimental and early support for
   [https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/blob/master/README.arm.md]ARM is
   available too.
   ## Source Download and Compilation

   First, acquire the source code by cloning the git repository:
git clone git://github.com/JuliaLang/julia.git

   (If you are behind a firewall, you may need to use the https protocol
   instead of the git protocol:
git config --global url."https://".insteadOf git://

   Be sure to also configure your system to use the appropriate proxy
   settings, e.g. by setting the https_proxy and http_proxy variables.)

   By default you will be building the latest unstable version of Julia.
   However, most users should use the most recent stable version of Julia,
   which is currently the 0.3 series of releases. You can get this version
   by changing to the Julia directory and running
git checkout release-0.3

   Now run make to build the julia executable. To perform a parallel
   build, use make -j N and supply the maximum number of concurrent
   processes. When compiled the first time, it will automatically download
   and build its
   [file://localhost/Users/admin/Pros/sh/awesome/awe_raw/julia#Required-Bu
   ild-Tools-External-Libraries]external dependencies. This takes a while,
   but only has to be done once. If the defaults in the build do not work
   for you, and you need to set specific make parameters, you can save
   them in Make.user. The build will automatically check for the existence
   of Make.user and use it if it exists. Building Julia requires 1.5GiB of
   disk space and approximately 700MiB of virtual memory.

   If you need to build Julia in an environment that does not allow access
   to the outside world, use make -C deps getall to download all the
   necessary files. Then, copy the julia directory over to the target
   environment and build with make.

   Note: the build process will not work if any of the build directory's
   parent directories have spaces in their names (this is due to a
   limitation in GNU make).

   Once it is built, you can run the julia executable using its full path
   in the directory created above (the julia directory), or, to run it
   from anywhere, either
     * add a soft link to the julia executable in the julia directory to
       /usr/local/bin (or any suitable directory already in your path), or
     * add the julia directory to your executable path for this shell
       session (in bash: export PATH="$(pwd):$PATH" ; in csh or tcsh: set
       path= ( $path $cwd ) ), or
     * add the julia directory to your executable path permanently (e.g.
       in .bash_profile), or
     * write prefix=/path/to/install/folder into Make.user and then run
       make install. If there is a version of Julia already installed in
       this folder, you should delete it before running make install.

   Now you should be able to run Julia like this:
julia

   If everything works correctly, you will see a Julia banner and an
   interactive prompt into which you can enter expressions for evaluation.
   (Errors related to libraries might be caused by old, incompatible
   libraries sitting around in your PATH. In that case, try moving the
   julia directory earlier in the PATH).

   Your first test of Julia should be to determine whether your build is
   working properly. From the UNIX/Windows command prompt inside the julia
   source directory, type make testall. You should see output that lists a
   series of tests being run; if they complete without error, you should
   be in good shape to start using Julia.

   You can read about [http://julialang.org/manual/getting-started]getting
   started in the manual.

   If you are building a Julia package for distribution on Linux, OS X, or
   Windows, take a look at the detailed notes in
   [https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/blob/master/DISTRIBUTING.md]DISTRIB
   UTING.md.

Updating an existing source tree

   If you have previously downloaded julia using git clone, you can update
   the existing source tree using git pull rather than starting anew:
cd julia
git pull && make

   Assuming that you had made no changes to the source tree that will
   conflict with upstream updates, these commands will trigger a build to
   update to the latest version.

General troubleshooting

    1. Over time, the base library may accumulate enough changes such that
       the bootstrapping process in building the system image will fail.
       If this happens, the build may fail with an error like
 *** This error is usually fixed by running 'make clean'. If the error persists, try 'make cleanall' ***
       As described, running make clean && make is usually sufficient.
       Occasionally, the stronger cleanup done by make cleanall is needed.
    2. New versions of external dependencies may be introduced which may
       occasionally cause conflicts with existing builds of older
       versions.
       a. Special make targets exist to help wipe the existing build of a
       dependency. For example, make -C deps clean-llvm will clean out the
       existing build of llvm so that llvm will be rebuilt from the
       downloaded source distribution the next time make is called. make
       -C deps distclean-llvm is a stronger wipe which will also delete
       the downloaded source distribution, ensuring that a fresh copy of
       the source distribution will be downloaded and that any new patches
       will be applied the next time make is called.
       b. To delete existing binaries of julia and all its dependencies,
       delete the ./usr directory in the source tree.
    3. If you've upgraded OS X recently and you get an error that looks
       like ld: library not found for -lcrt1.10.6.o, run xcode-select
       --install.
    4. If you've moved the source directory, you might get errors such as
       CMake Error: The current CMakeCache.txt directory ... is different
       than the directory ... where CMakeCache.txt was created., in which
       case you may delete the offending dependency under deps
    5. In extreme cases, you may wish to reset the source tree to a
       pristine state. The following git commands may be helpful:
 git reset --hard #Forcibly remove any changes to any files under version control
 git clean -x -f -d #Forcibly remove any file or directory not under version control
       To avoid losing work, make sure you know what these commands do
       before you run them. git will not be able to undo these changes!

   ## Uninstalling Julia

   Julia does not install anything outside the directory it was cloned
   into. Julia can be completely uninstalled by deleting this directory.
   Julia packages are installed in ~/.julia by default, and can be
   uninstalled by deleting ~/.julia.
   ## Platform-Specific Build Notes

Linux

General

     * GCC version 4.7 or later is required to build Julia.
     * To use external shared libraries not in the system library search
       path, set USE_SYSTEM_XXX=1 and
       LDFLAGS=-Wl,-rpath,/path/to/dir/contains/libXXX.so in Make.user.
          + Instead of setting LDFLAGS, putting the library directory into
            the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH (at both compile and
            run time) also works.
     * See also the
       [file://localhost/Users/admin/Pros/sh/awesome/awe_raw/julia#Require
       d-Build-Tools-External-Libraries]external dependencies.

Architecture Customization

   Julia can be built for a non-generic architecture by configuring the
   ARCH Makefile variable. See the appropriate section of Make.inc for
   additional customization options, such as MARCH and JULIA_CPU_TARGET.

   For example, to build for Pentium 4, set MARCH=pentium4 and install the
   necessary system libraries for linking. On Ubuntu, these may include
   lib32gfortran3 (also manually call ln -s /usr/lib32/libgfortran3.so.0
   /usr/lib32/libgfortran3.so) and lib32gcc1, lib32stdc++6, among others.

   You can also set MARCH=native for a maximum-performance build
   customized for the current machine CPU.

Ubuntu

   The
   [https://launchpad.net/%7Estaticfloat/+archive/julia-deps/]julia-deps
   PPA contains updated packages for Julia dependencies if you want to use
   system libraries instead of having them downloaded and built during the
   build process. See
   [file://localhost/Users/admin/Pros/sh/awesome/awe_raw/julia#System-Prov
   ided-Libraries]System Provided Libraries.

   For a fast and easy current installation, the before_install section of
   [https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/blob/master/.travis.yml]travis.yml
   is a great resource. Note that those instructions are for Ubuntu 12.04,
   and for later versions you may need to install newer versions of
   dependencies, such as libunwind8-dev instead of libunwind7-dev.

RHEL/CentOS 6

   On RHEL/CentOS 6 systems, the default compiler (gcc 4.4) is too old to
   build Julia.

   Install or contact your systems administrator to install a more recent
   version of gcc. The
   [http://linux.web.cern.ch/linux/devtoolset/]Scientific Linux Developer
   Toolset works well.

Linux Build Troubleshooting

   Problem Possible Solution
   OpenBLAS build failure Set one of the following build options in
   Make.user and build again:
     * OPENBLAS_TARGET_ARCH=BARCELONA (AMD CPUs) or
       OPENBLAS_TARGET_ARCH=NEHALEM (Intel CPUs)
        Set OPENBLAS_DYNAMIC_ARCH = 0 to disable compiling multiple
            architectures in a single binary.
     * OPENBLAS_NO_AVX2 = 1 disables AVX2 instructions, allowing OpenBLAS
       to compile with OPENBLAS_DYNAMIC_ARCH = 1 using old versions of
       binutils
     * USE_SYSTEM_BLAS=1 uses the system provided libblas
          + Set LIBBLAS=-lopenblas and LIBBLASNAME=libopenblas to force
            the use of the system provided OpenBLAS when multiple BLAS
            versions are installed.

   If you get an error that looks like
   ../kernel/x86_64/dgemm_kernel_4x4_haswell.S:1709: Error: no such
   instruction: `vpermpd $ 0xb1,%ymm0,%ymm0', then you need to set
   OPENBLAS_DYNAMIC_ARCH = 0 or OPENBLAS_NO_AVX2 = 1, or you need a newer
   version of binutils (2.18 or newer).
   ([https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/7653]Issue #7653)
   Illegal Instruction error Check if your CPU supports AVX while your OS
   does not (e.g. through virtualization, as described in
   [https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/3263]this issue).

OS X

   It is essential to use a 64-bit gfortran to compile Julia dependencies.
   The gfortran-4.7 (and newer) compilers in Brew, Fink, and MacPorts work
   for building Julia. Clang is now used by default to build Julia on OS X
   (10.7 and above). It is recommended that you upgrade to the latest
   version of Xcode (at least 4.3.3.). You need to have the Xcode command
   line utilities installed (and updated): run xcode-select --install in
   the terminal (in Xcode prior to v5.0, you can alternatively go to
   Preferences -> Downloads and select the Command Line Utilities). This
   will ensure that clang v3.1 is installed, which is the minimum version
   of clang required to build Julia. On OS X 10.6, the Julia build will
   automatically use gcc.

   If you have set LD_LIBRARY_PATH or DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH in your .bashrc or
   equivalent, Julia may be unable to find various libraries that come
   bundled with it. These environment variables need to be unset for Julia
   to work.

   If you see build failures in OpenBLAS or if you prefer to experiment,
   you can use the Apple provided BLAS in vecLib by building with
   USE_SYSTEM_BLAS=1. Julia does not use the Apple provided LAPACK, as it
   is too old.

   When building Julia, or its dependencies, libraries installed by third
   party package managers can redirect the compiler to use an incompatible
   version of the software it is looking for. One example of this
   happening is when a piece of software called the "linker" gives an
   error involving "Undefined symbols." If that happens, you can usually
   figure out what software package is causing the error from the names in
   the error text. This sort of error can be bypassed by, temporarily,
   uninstalling the offending package. If the offending package cannot be
   uninstalled by itself, it may be possible to just uninstall the
   development headers (for example: a package ending in "-dev" in Fink).

FreeBSD

   On FreeBSD Release 9.0, install the gcc47, git, and gmake
   packages/ports, and compile Julia with the command:
$ gmake FC=gfortran47

   You must use the gmake command on FreeBSD instead of make.

Windows

   In order to build Julia on Windows, see
   [https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/blob/master/README.windows.md]READM
   E.windows.

Vagrant

   Julia can be developed in an isolated Vagrant environment. See
   [https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/blob/master/contrib/vagrant/README.
   md]the Vagrant README for details.

   4.pdf?raw=true]slides.
   ### System Provided Libraries

   If you already have one or more of these packages installed on your
   system, you can prevent Julia from compiling duplicates of these
   libraries by passing USE_SYSTEM_...=1 to make or adding the line to
   Make.user. The complete list of possible flags can be found in
   Make.inc.

   Please be aware that this procedure is not officially supported, as it
   introduces additional variability into the installation and versioning
   of the dependencies, and is recommended only for system package
   maintainers. Unexpected compile errors may result, as the build system
   will do no further checking to ensure the proper packages are
   installed.

SuiteSparse

   SuiteSparse is a special case, since it is typically only installed as
   a static library, while USE_SYSTEM_SUITESPARSE=1 requires that it is a
   shared library. Running the script
   contrib/repackage_system_suitesparse4.make will copy your static system
   SuiteSparse installation into the shared library format required by
   Julia. make USE_SYSTEM_SUITESPARSE=1 will then use the SuiteSparse that
   has been copied into Julia's directory, but will not build a new
   SuiteSparse library from scratch.

Intel compilers and Math Kernel Library (MKL)

   To build Julia using the Intel compilers (icc, icpc, ifort), and link
   against the [http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-mkl]MKL
   BLAS and LAPACK libraries, first make sure you have a recent version of
   the compiler suite (version 15 or later).

   For a 64-bit architecture, the environment should be set up as follows:
# bash
source /path/to/intel/bin/compilervars.sh intel64

   Add the following to the Make.user file:
USEICC = 1
USEIFC = 1
USE_INTEL_MKL = 1
USE_INTEL_MKL_FFT = 1
USE_INTEL_LIBM = 1

   It is highly recommended to start with a fresh clone of the Julia
   repository.
   ## Source Code Organization

   The Julia source code is organized as follows:
base/          source code for Julia's standard library
contrib/       editor support for Julia source, miscellaneous scripts
deps/          external dependencies
doc/manual     source for the user manual
doc/stdlib     source for standard library function help text
examples/      example Julia programs
src/           source for Julia language core
test/          test suites
test/perf      benchmark suites
ui/            source for various front ends
usr/           binaries and shared libraries loaded by Julia's standard libraries

   ## Binary Installation

   Because of the rapid pace of development at this point, we recommend
   installing the latest Julia from source, but platform-specific tarballs
   with pre-compiled binaries are also
   [http://julialang.org/downloads/]available for download.

   You can either run the julia executable using its full path in the
   directory created above, or add that directory to your executable path
   so that you can run the Julia program from anywhere (in the current
   shell session):
export PATH="$(pwd)/julia:$PATH"

   Now you should be able to run Julia like this:
julia

   On Windows, double-click usr/bin/julia.exe.

   If everything works correctly, you will see a Julia banner and an
   interactive prompt into which you can enter expressions for evaluation.
   You can read about [http://julialang.org/manual/getting-started]getting
   started in the manual.

   ## Editor and Terminal Setup

   Currently, Julia editing mode support is available for Emacs, Vim,
   Textmate, Sublime Text, Notepad++, and Kate, in contrib/. There is
   early support for IDEs such as [http://junolab.org/]Juno,
   [http://brainwy.github.io/liclipse/]Eclipse (LiClipse). A notebook
   interface is available through
   [https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl]IJulia, which adds Julia
   support to [http://jupyter.org/]Jupyter/[http://ipython.org/]IPython.
   The [https://github.com/quinnj/Sublime-IJulia]Sublime-IJulia plugin
   enables interaction between IJulia and Sublime Text.

   In the terminal, Julia makes great use of both control-key and meta-key
   bindings. To make the meta-key bindings more accessible, many terminal
   emulator programs (e.g., Terminal, iTerm, xterm, etc.) allow you to use
   the alt or option key as meta. See the section in the manual on
   [http://docs.julialang.org/en/latest/manual/interacting-with-julia/]int
   eracting with Julia for more details.
