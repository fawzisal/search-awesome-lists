   SaltStack is the other configuration management system built with
   Python.
   It takes a new approach to infrastructure management by developing
   software that is easy enough to get running in seconds, scalable enough
   to manage tens of thousands of servers, and fast enough to control and
   communicate with them in milliseconds.
   SaltStack software manages system infrastructure and the application
   stacks that run on it and is used by web-scale application developers,
   DevOps teams and systems administrators.

   A means really awesome / useful.
