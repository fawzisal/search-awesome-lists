Awesome

     A curated list of awesome resources for electronic engineers and
     hobbyists

   Electronic engineering (EE) is the practice of understanding, designing
   and building electronic circuits. It is often differentiated from
   electrical engineering in that it mostly deals with low power DC
   electronic circuits rather than high power AC systems but there is a
   lot of overlap between electronic and electrical engineering.

   Experimenting with and building electronic circuits is also a popular
   hobby and many professional resources are often equally applicable to
   hobbyists and vice versa.

   This list is for websites, services, software, tools and more:
   everything that you think is awesome in the world of electronic
   engineering. If you have anything to add please follow the instructions
   in
   [file://localhost/monostable/awesome-electronics/blob/master/contributi
   ng.md]contributing.md.
