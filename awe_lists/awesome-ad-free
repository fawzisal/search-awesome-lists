     A curated list of ad-free alternatives to popular services on the
     internet.

     Am I saying you should refrain from using an ad blocker? No. But
     consider offsetting your act of disobedience with an act of
     affirmative support. Vote with your wallet. Put some money behind
     the writing you like--whether it's a website or a magazine or a
     newspaper. "But such-and-such website won't let me pay for it." Then
     discover something new.

   --Matthew Butterick
