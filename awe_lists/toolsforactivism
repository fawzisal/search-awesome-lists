   [https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome]Awesome

   Below is a curated list of awesome digital tools for activism. These
   are tools for individuals, ad-hoc groups or formal organizations that
   are campaigning, organizing or communicating for social change. Some of
   these tools are open source projects that requires some technical
   knowledge to set up and host yourself. Some are software-as-a-service
   tools that you use by going to a webpage in your browser. Feel free to
   share suggestions.
