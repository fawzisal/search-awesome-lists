     * [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_visualization]What is Audio
       Visualization?

     Music visualization, a feature found in electronic music visualizers
     and media player software, generates animated imagery based on a
     piece of music. The imagery is usually generated and rendered in
     real time and in a way synchronized with the music as it is played.
