Awesome

     A carefully curated list of awesome Python asyncio frameworks,
     libraries, software and resources.

   The Python [https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html]asyncio
   module introduced to the standard library with Python 3.4 provides
   infrastructure for writing single-threaded concurrent code using
   coroutines, multiplexing I/O access over sockets and other resources,
   running network clients and servers, and other related primitives.

   Asyncio is not really a brand-new technology however it appears to be
   very trending since a few years - especially in the Python community
   and with the release of Python 3.4 in March 2016. Thus, it's pretty
   hard to keep yourself up-to-date with the most awesome packages out
   there. Find some of those awesome packages here and if you are missing
   one we count on you to
   [https://github.com/timofurrer/awesome-asyncio/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING
   .md]create an Issue or a Pull Request with your suggestion.
