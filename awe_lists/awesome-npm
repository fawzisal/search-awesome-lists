Tips

Update to the latest npm version

$ npm install --global npm

   [https://github.com/felixrieseberg/npm-windows-upgrade]Windows users,
   read more.

Command aliases

     * npm i -> npm install
     * npm i -D -> npm install --save-dev
     * npm t -> npm test
     * npm it -> npm install && npm test
     * npm r -> npm uninstall

Shell aliases

   Speed up your common npm tasks.

   In your .zshrc/.bashrc:
alias ni='npm install'
alias nid='npm install --save-dev'
alias nig='npm install --global'
alias nt='npm test'
alias nit='npm install && npm test'
alias nk='npm link'
alias nr='npm run'
alias ns='npm start'
alias nf='npm cache clean && rm -rf node_modules && npm install'
alias nlg='npm list --global --depth=0'

Don't add to package.json when installing

   By default npm adds packages you install to the dependencies field in
   package.json (since v5). You can prevent this by specifying the
   --no-save flag. You can add a package to devDependencies with
   --save-dev/-D:
$ npm install --save-dev ava

Run scripts

   You can easily [https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/run-script]run scripts using
   npm by adding them to the "scripts" field in package.json and run them
   with npm run <script-name>. Run npm run to see available scripts.
   Binaries of locally install packages are made available in the
   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable)]PATH, so you can run
   them by name. npm run foo will also run prefoo and postfoo if defined.
{
        "name": "awesome-package",
        "scripts": {
                "cat": "cat-names"
        },
        "dependencies": {
                "cat-names": "^1.0.0"
        }
}

$ npm run cat
Max

   All package.json properties are
   [https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts#packagejson-vars]exposed as
   environment variables:
{
        "name": "awesome-package",
        "scripts": {
                "name": "echo $npm_package_name"
        }
}

$ npm run name
awesome-package

Passing options to commands

   You can pass options to the command you are using in your npm script by
   adding -- --flag like in the example below. The --
   [https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/11376/what-does-double-dash-m
   ean-also-known-as-bare-double-dash]marks the end of options parsing, so
   npm run will just ignore it and pass it to the command.
{
        "name": "awesome-package",
        "scripts": {
                "xo": "xo",
                "xo:fix": "npm run xo -- --fix",
        }
}

   Adding the -- --fix option is like executing xo --fix.

Silent option

   npm run has a --silent option which is especially useful when combining
   npm scripts.

   Imagine you have a setup for linting your JavaScript files like the
   following:
{
        "name": "awesome-package",
        "scripts": {
                "xo": "xo",
                "xo:fix": "npm run xo --silent -- --fix",
        }
}

   Using the --silent option reduces the output in the terminal. See
   [https://twitter.com/mkuehnel/status/957965749473210369]this
   comparison.

Run script with npx

   npm
   [https://medium.com/@maybekatz/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner-55
   f7d4bd282b]comes bundled with npx (Since v5.2.0) -- a tool to execute
   package binaries. Each command is executed either from the local
   node_modules/.bin directory, or from a central cache, installing any
   packages needed in order for <command> to run.
{
        "name": "awesome-package",
        "dependencies": {
                "cat-names": "^1.0.0"
        }
}

   If the binary is already installed, it will be executed from
   node_modules/.bin.
$ npx cat-names
Max

   But if the binary is missing, it will be installed first.
$ npx dog-names
npx: installed 46 in 3.136s
Bentley

Run commands with different Node.js versions

   With npx (Comes bundled with npm v5.2.0 or newer) and the
   [https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-bin]node-bin package, you can
   easily try out code in different Node.js versions without having to use
   a version manager like [http://nvm.sh/]nvm,
   [https://github.com/isaacs/nave]nave, or [https://github.com/tj/n]n.
$ npx --package=node-bin@6.11.0 -- node --version
v6.11.0

Link local packages

   Sometimes it can be useful to have a local version of a package as a
   dependency. You can use npm link to link one local package into
   another. Run npm link in the package you want to use. This creates a
   global reference. Then go into your original package and run npm link
   <package-name> to link in the other package.
$ cd rainbow
$ npm link
$ cd ../unicorn
$ npm link rainbow

   You can now use rainbow as a dependency in the unicorn package.

Install a package from GitHub

   npm supports using a shorthand for installing a package directly from a
   GitHub repo:
$ npm install sindresorhus/chalk

   Let's target a specific commit as master is a moving target:
$ npm install 'sindresorhus/chalk#51b8f32'

   Specify either a commit SHA, branch, tag, or nothing.

   You can also install Git dependencies with semver: (Requires npm v5 or
   newer)
$ npm install 'sindresorhus/chalk#semver:^2.0.0'

Install a specific version of a package

$ npm install chalk@1.0.0

List top-level installed packages and their version

$ npm ls --depth=0

Command help

   Get help docs for a command:
$ npm help <command>

   Example:
$ npm help install

Standalone version of a package

   Quickly get a standalone version of a package that is browserified and
   usable in the browser.
https://wzrd.in/standalone/<package-name>[@<version>]

   Examples:
     * [https://wzrd.in/standalone/object-assign]https://wzrd.in/standalon
       e/object-assign
     * [https://wzrd.in/standalone/object-assign@4.0.0]https://wzrd.in/sta
       ndalone/object-assign@4.0.0

   Great for prototyping, but download the file or use Browserify yourself
   for production.
