Awesome

What This Is, and Where It Comes From

   Since 2013-ish, [https://twitter.com/tenaciousjoe]Joe Goldberg, who
   created the original document inspiring this list, read a crap-ton of
   books and articles about "leadership" and "management" and took notes
   along the way. He shared it with friends who were transitioning to
   management roles and eventually decided to open-source it.
   [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1R1O0OEsQpZcBcLheRlomDrmR2tyEpdRNFn
   jbLALmbH4/edit#heading=h.loq53mbwc6ut]Here you'll find Joe's
   still-public document, which provides meatier summaries of the articles
   you'll find listed here as well as lots of supplementary notes.

   In summer 2017 [https://twitter.com/lauritaapplez]Lauri Apple found out
   about Joe's docs via [http://softwareleadweekly.com/]Software Lead
   Weekly and asked Joe about posting the contents to GitHub. He gave the
   greenlight. Lauri changed up the format (very brief blurbs), turned the
   doc into an [https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome]Awesome List, and
   has continued adding new entries ever since. Helping out with the
   initial upload were a team of Lauri's former colleagues at
   [https://jobs.zalando.com/tech/]Zalando. These days the list receives
   contributions from people around the world.

     * "Thanks again for putting together this tremendous
       resource!"--[https://twitter.com/xdg]Dave Golden, MongoDB and
       contributor -- "I have hunted and used this repeatedly in the last
       few months and referred many others to the material. So thank
       you--it's making a real difference in more ways than you could
       Imagine! :)" --Dave Igoe, via Slack

Who is this for?

     * Individual contributors (ICs) looking to move into a management
       role but not sure if it's right for them
     * ICs who want to stay ICs but want to have more influence in their
       orgs
     * ICs who recently moved into a management role
     * Managers looking to level-up a particular skill
     * Managers transitioning to meta-management (managing managers)

Why should you read this or trust the authors for advice?

   You shouldn't. Much of this is self-contradictory. Some seemed like
   good advice at the time. Little of it is original, even less is written
   by me. Don't read this cover-to-cover. Scan the Table of Contents and
   pick a topic you'd like to learn more about. Joe has highlighted the
   absolutely most essential content (a few dozen articles, six books, and
   a handful of videos, checklists, and slide decks).

How can I submit a link or ask a question?

   First off, we'd love that! For submissions, follow our
   contributing guidelines. For questions, go ahead and
   post an issue in our Issues Tracker.

   Please let us know via the Issues Tracker if there's a topic you'd like
   this list to include.

Did you write all this yourself? (Credit/Attribution)

   Almost none of the content shared in this list is by the authors. Where
   there's a link, the content below it is generally a summary of the
   linked webpage. When there's no link, it's either original content or
   gives credit/attribution. Some book summaries are from
   [https://personalmba.com/]Personal MBA, which Joe piloted and consulted
   on, but not to the extent where he is willing to take credit for its
   content.
