   Resources to help independent developers make money.

   Making money from your own code has never been easier, but it's still
   hard. Here, I try to curate a list of resources to help everyone
   interested in making money from their digital products get inspired and
   give it a try. Be it monetizing side-projects, bootstrapping business
   ideas, etc.

   Projects don't need to be big, actually, it's better if they are not,
   they just need to be profitable. They might provide a passive income
   after the initial bulk of work, and who knows, maybe even help you
   reach financial independence.

   Going indie does have lots of lifestyle perks :)

   All these resources might help inspire you and put you on the right
   track but in the end what matters is to MAKE and TRY stuff. So devour
   this content responsibly :)

   Contributions are more than welcome.

       Lightning 7 minute talk by one of the most respected indie

       have low competition and be very profitable from a solo business
       point of view.

Courses

   Again, I'm not quite fond of listing [$] products made by indie
   developers targeting indie developers, especially because I haven't
   tried them myself, but due to several references I assume they are
   probably worth it and some people might find value in learning about
   them.
