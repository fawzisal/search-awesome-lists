Tags

requires-approval

   While many companies use the public repositories feature of GitHub,
   Bitbucket, and GitLab to determine the Open Source status of a project,
   there are others who require more verification. These companies have
   been marked with a requires-approval tag, indicating that an
   application process is required to take advantage of their Open Source
   benefits.

non-commercial

   Some companies make their products available for open source, but only
   for non-commercial projects. These companies have been marked with a
   non-commercial tag.
