The Concept

   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_enhancement]Progressive
   Enhancement means gradually improving the user experience after
   verifying the target environment (e.g. browser) is capable of it. Start
   with content and ensure you maintain functionality & accessibility.

       Approach - Provide wide access to content without technological
       restrictions.

Feature Detection

   Before you try to enhance the experience, you need to ensure the
   environment is capable of the enhancement. You test this by performing
   feature detections:
     * [https://www.sitepoint.com/an-introduction-to-css-supports-rule-fea
       ture-queries/]CSS feature queries
       ([https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/CSS/supports]CSS.su

       [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@supports]@suppor
       ts()) - Natively test if specific CSS feature is supported using JS
       method or CSS declaration.

       asynchronously load CSS & JS after a set pre-defined feature tests.

Support Tables

   Different environments (platforms, browsers, versions) have different
   capabilities. Support tables tell you what capabilities each
   environment has. Knowing the level of support can help you weigh an
   enhancement against the effort and impact of its implementation.
