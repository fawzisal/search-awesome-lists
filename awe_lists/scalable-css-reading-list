README.md

Awesome

   A list of things to read or watch that address these two questions:
   What is scalable CSS? and How do we create scalable CSS?

   By scalable CSS, I mean CSS that is
     * capable of remaining effective, coherent, extendable, and
       maintainable as projects grow over time
     * capable of being understood and worked on by any number of
       different people in a consistent, systematic way

   Included are resources that articulate key principles and practices.
   The list is restricted to the articles that I consider the most
   important to read -- that is, the best explanations (of which I'm
   aware) for different approaches to the problems.

   If you know of a resource that should be added, please share! File an
   issue or a pull request.

   (There are plenty of other problems related to CSS: understanding how
   it works, using specific properties, accomplishing specific styles,
   achieving responsive design, boosting performance, etc. This list is
   strictly focused on the problem of creating scalable CSS.)

   None of the sections present any kind of "ranking" or "suggested
   reading order." Just read them all.

CSS Styleguides

   These styleguides articulate conventions and guidelines for authoring
   scalable CSS.

   (I'm distinguishing styleguides from what I would call pattern
   libraries, which are references created to document and exemplify
   existing styles rather than guidelines for the authoring of the styles.
   Other people often use the term styleguide to refer to both or either
   of these reference types. I think pattern libraries are less
   specifically about scalable CSS, and more about a scalable frontend
   design and development workflow; so I'm not including resources related
   to pattern libraries.)

   Articles providing overviews of real-life CSS methodologies for
   production sites and apps of significant scale. Although these articles
   generally don't include principles that are not better explained in the
   articles and longer reads above, they are so pragmatic and concrete
   that they are important reads in their own right. Newest first.
