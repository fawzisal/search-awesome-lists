   A curated collection of Progressive Web Apps resources.

   [https://pwabook.com/oreillyapwa]Building Progressive Web Apps

     Progressive web apps are a new breed of web apps. They combine the
     benefits of a native app with the low friction nature of the web.
     Progressive web apps start off as simple websites, but as the user
     interacts with them, they progressively gain new powers. They
     transform from a website into something much more like a traditional
     native app.
