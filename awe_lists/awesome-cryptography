Theory

Algorithms

Symmetric encryption

     * [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_DES]3DES - Symmetric-key
       block cipher (or Triple Data Encryption Algorithm (TDEA or Triple
       DEA), which applies the Data Encryption Standard (DES) cipher
       algorithm three times to each data block.
     * [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard]AES -
       Symmetric-key block cipher algorithm and U.S. government standard
       for secure and classified data encryption and decryption (also
       known as Rijndael).
     * [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blowfish_(cipher)]Blowfish -
       Symmetric-key block cipher, designed in 1993 by Bruce Schneier.
       Notable features of the design include key-dependent S-boxes and a
       highly complex key schedule.

Asymmetric encryption

     * [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)]RSA - One of the
       first practical public-key cryptosystems and is widely used for
       secure data transmission. In RSA, this asymmetry is based on the
       practical difficulty of factoring the product of two large prime
       numbers, the factoring problem.

Hash functions

     * [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5]MD5 - Widely used hash function
       producing a 128-bit hash value. MD5 was initially designed to be
       used as a cryptographic hash function, but it has been found to
       suffer from extensive vulnerabilities. It can still be used as a
       checksum to verify data integrity, but only against unintentional
       corruption.
     * [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1]SHA1 - Cryptographic hash
       function designed by the NSA. SHA-1 produces a 160-bit hash value
       known as a message digest. SHA-1 is no longer considered secure
       against well-funded opponents.
     * [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2]SHA2 - Set of hash functions
       designed by the NSA. SHA-256 and SHA-512 are novel hash functions
       computed with 32-bit and 64-bit words, respectively. They use
       different shift amounts and additive constants, but their
       structures are otherwise virtually identical, differing only in the
       number of rounds.

       Numbers in Various Programming Languages.
