What is an open company?

   An open company is defined, for the purposes of this list, as a
   for-profit organization whose core practices are guided by principles
   of openness, transparency and interoperability. This philosophy can be
   summarized by the maxim:

     Share as much as possible, charge as little as possible.

   derived from the
   [http://blog.gittip.com/post/26350459746/the-first-open-company/]origin
   al formulation by Gittip (now [http://gratipay.com/]Gratipay).

   In practice, this often means:
     * releasing its products as
       [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software]free
       and open source software,
       [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_content]open content, or
       [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_hardware]open source
       hardware
     * using [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_standard]open standards
       and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interoperability]inter-operable
       formats
     * developing its products openly, using public communication channels
     * publishing as much financial and operational data as possible,
       without compromising customer privacy.
     * etc.

   The following pages provide a more detailed overview of this concept:
