Summary

   The OSSU curriculum is a complete education in computer science using
   online materials. It's not merely for career training or professional
   development. It's for those who want a proper, well-rounded grounding
   in concepts fundamental to all computing disciplines, and for those who
   have the discipline, will, and (most importantly!) good habits to
   obtain this education largely on their own, but with support from a
   worldwide community of fellow learners.

   It is designed according to the degree requirements of undergraduate
   computer science majors, minus general education (non-CS) requirements,
   as it is assumed most of the people following this curriculum are
   already educated outside the field of CS. The courses themselves are
   among the very best in the world, often coming from Harvard, Princeton,
   MIT, etc., but specifically chosen to meet the following criteria.

   Courses must:
     * Be open for enrollment
     * Run regularly (ideally in self-paced format, otherwise running at
       least once a month or so)
     * Fulfill the
       ac
       ademic requirements of OSSU
     * Fit neatly into the progression of the curriculum with respect to
       topics and difficulty level
     * Be of generally high quality in teaching materials and pedagogical
       principles

   When no course meets the above criteria, the coursework is supplemented
   with a book. When there are courses or books that don't fit into the
   curriculum but are otherwise of high quality, they belong in
   extr
   as/courses or
   ext
   ras/readings.

   Organization. The curriculum is designed as follows:
     * Intro CS: for students to try out CS and see if it's right for them
     * Core CS: corresponds roughly to the first three years of a computer
       science curriculum, taking classes that all majors would be
       required to take
     * Advanced CS: corresponds roughly to the final year of a computer
       science curriculum, taking electives according to the student's
       interests
     * Final Project: a project for students to validate, consolidate, and
       display their knowledge, to be evaluated by their peers worldwide
     * Pro CS: graduate-level specializations students can elect to take
       after completing the above curriculum if they want to maximize
       their chances of getting a good job

   Duration. It is possible to finish Core CS within about 2 years if you
   plan carefully and devote roughly 18-22 hours/week to your studies.
   Courses in Core CS should be taken linearly if possible, but since a
   perfectly linear progression is rarely possible, each class's
   prerequisites is specified so that you can design a logical but
   non-linear progression based on the class schedules and your own life
   plans.

   Cost. All or nearly all course material prior to Pro CS is available
   for free, however some courses may charge money for
   assignments/tests/projects to be graded. Note that Coursera offers
   [https://learner.coursera.help/hc/en-us/articles/209819033-Apply-for-Fi
   nancial-Aid]financial aid. Decide how much or how little to spend based
   on your own time and budget; just remember that you can't purchase
   success!

   Content policy. If you plan on showing off some of your coursework
   publicly, you must share only files that you are allowed to. Do NOT
   disrespect the code of conduct that you signed in the beginning of each
   course!

Prerequisites

     * Core CS assumes the student has already taken high
       school math and physics, including algebra, geometry, and
       pre-calculus. Some high school graduates will have already taken AP
       Calculus, but this is usually only about 3/4 of a college calculus
       class, so the calculus courses in the curriculum are still
       recommended.
     * [file://localhost/Users/admin/Pros/sh/awesome/awe_raw/computer-scie
       nce#advanced-cs]Advanced CS assumes the student has already taken
       the entirety of Core CS and is knowledgeable enough now to decide
       which electives to take.
     * Note that
       Advanced systems assumes the student has taken
       a basic physics course (e.g. AP Physics in high school).

Advanced CS

   After completing every required course in Core CS, students should
   choose a subset of courses from Advanced CS based on interest. Not
   every course from a subcategory needs to be taken. But students should
   take every course that is relevant to the field they intend to go into.

   The Advanced CS study should then end with one of the Specializations
   under
   [file://localhost/Users/admin/Pros/sh/awesome/awe_raw/computer-science#
   advanced-applications]Advanced applications. A Specialization's
   Capstone, if taken, may act as the
   Final project, if permitted by the Honor Code of the
   course. If not, or if a student chooses not to take the Capstone, then
   a separate Final project will need to be done to complete this
   curriculum.

Advanced applications

   These Coursera Specializations all end with a Capstone project.
   Depending on the course, you may be able to utilize the Capstone as
   your Final Project for this Computer Science curriculum. Note that
   doing a Specialization with the Capstone at the end always costs money.
   So if you don't wish to spend money or use the Capstone as your Final,
   it may be possible to take the courses in the Specialization for free
   by manually searching for them, but not all allow this.

Final project

   OSS University is project-focused. You are encouraged to do the
   assignments and exams for each course, but what really matters is
   whether you can use your knowledge to solve a real world problem.

   After you've gotten through all of Core CS and the parts of Advanced CS
   relevant to you, you should think about a problem that you can solve
   using the knowledge you've acquired. Not only does real project work
   look great on a resume, the project will validate and consolidate your
   knowledge. You can create something entirely new, or you can find an
   existing project that needs help via websites like
   [https://www.codetriage.com/]CodeTriage or
   [http://www.firsttimersonly.com/]First Timers Only.

   Another option is using the Capstone project from taking one of the
   Specializations in
   Advanced applications; whether or not this makes
   sense depends on the course, the project, and whether or not the
   course's Honor Code permits you to display your work publicly. In some
   cases, it may not be permitted; do not violate your course's Honor
   Code!

   Put the OSSU-CS badge in the README of your repository!

Evaluation

   Upon completing your final project, submit your project's information
   to
   PROJECTS
   via a pull request and use our
   community channels to announce it to your fellow students.

   Your peers and mentors from OSSU will then informally evaluate your
   project. You will not be "graded" in the traditional sense -- everyone
   has their own measurements for what they consider a success. The
   purpose of the evaluation is to act as your first announcement to the
   world that you are a computer scientist, and to get experience
   listening to feedback -- both positive and negative -- and taking it in
   stride.

   The final project evaluation has a second purpose: to evaluate whether
   OSSU, through its community and curriculum, is successful in its
   mission to guide independent learners in obtaining a world-class
   computer science education.

Cooperative work

   You can create this project alone or with other students! We love
   cooperative work! Use our
   channels to communicate with other fellows to combine and
   create new projects!

Which programming languages should I use?

   My friend, here is the best part of liberty! You can use any language
   that you want to complete the final project.

   The important thing is to internalize the core concepts and to be able
   to use them with whatever tool (programming language) that you wish.

Pro CS

   After completing the requirements of the curriculum above, you will
   have completed the equivalent of a full bachelor's degree in Computer
   Science, or quite close to one. You can stop in the Advanced CS
   section, but the next step to completing your studies is to develop
   skills and knowledge in a specific domain. Many of these courses are
   graduate-level.

How to show your progress

    1. Create an account in [https://trello.com/]Trello.
    2. Copy [https://trello.com/b/9DPXYv5f]this board to your personal
       account. See how to copy a board
       [http://blog.trello.com/you-can-copy-boards-now-finally/]here.

   Now that you have a copy of our official board, you just need to pass
   the cards to the Doing column or Done column as you progress in your
   study.

   We also have labels to help you have more control through the process.
   The meaning of each of these labels is:
     * Main Curriculum: cards with that label represent courses that are
       listed in our curriculum.
     * Extra Resources: cards with that label represent courses that was
       added by the student.
     * Doing: cards with that label represent courses the student is
       current doing.
     * Done: cards with that label represent courses finished by the
       student. Those cards should also have the link for at least one
       project/article built with the knowledge acquired in such course.
     * Section: cards with that label represent the section that we have
       in our curriculum. Those cards with the Section label are only to
       help the organization of the Done column. You should put the
       Course's cards below its respective Section's card.

   The intention of this board is to provide our students a way to track
   their progress, and also the ability to show their progress through a
   public page for friends, family, employers, etc. You can change the
   status of your board to be public or private.
