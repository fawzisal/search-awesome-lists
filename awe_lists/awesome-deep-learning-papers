Awesome - Most Cited Deep Learning Papers

   [https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome]Awesome

   A curated list of the most cited deep learning papers (since 2012)

   We believe that there exist classic deep learning papers which are
   worth reading regardless of their application domain. Rather than
   providing overwhelming amount of papers, We would like to provide a
   curated list of the awesome deep learning papers which are considered
   as must-reads in certain research domains.

Background

   Before this list, there exist other awesome deep learning lists, for
   example, [https://github.com/kjw0612/awesome-deep-vision]Deep Vision
   and [https://github.com/kjw0612/awesome-rnn]Awesome Recurrent Neural
   Networks. Also, after this list comes out, another awesome list for
   deep learning beginners, called
   [https://github.com/songrotek/Deep-Learning-Papers-Reading-Roadmap]Deep
   Learning Papers Reading Roadmap, has been created and loved by many
   deep learning researchers.

   Although the Roadmap List includes lots of important deep learning
   papers, it feels overwhelming for me to read them all. As I mentioned
   in the introduction, I believe that seminal works can give us lessons
   regardless of their application domain. Thus, I would like to introduce
   top 100 deep learning papers here as a good starting point of
   overviewing deep learning researches.

   To get the news for newly released papers everyday, follow my
   [https://twitter.com/TerryUm_ML]twitter or
   [https://www.facebook.com/terryum.io/]facebook page!

Awesome list criteria

    1. A list of top 100 deep learning papers published from 2012 to 2016
       is suggested.
    2. If a paper is added to the list, another paper (usually from *More
       Papers from 2016" section) should be removed to keep top 100
       papers. (Thus, removing papers is also important contributions as
       well as adding papers)
    3. Papers that are important, but failed to be included in the list,
       will be listed in More than Top 100 section.
    4. Please refer to New Papers and Old Papers sections for the papers
       published in recent 6 months or before 2012.

   (Citation criteria)
     * < 6 months : New Papers (by discussion)
     * 2016 : +60 citations or "More Papers from 2016"
     * 2015 : +200 citations
     * 2014 : +400 citations
     * 2013 : +600 citations
     * 2012 : +800 citations
     * ~2012 : Old Papers (by discussion)

   Please note that we prefer seminal deep learning papers that can be
   applied to various researches rather than application papers. For that
   reason, some papers that meet the criteria may not be accepted while
   others can be. It depends on the impact of the paper, applicability to
   other researches scarcity of the research domain, and so on.

   We need your contributions!

   If you have any suggestions (missing papers, new papers, key
   researchers or typos), please feel free to edit and pull a request.
   (Please read the
   [https://github.com/terryum/awesome-deep-learning-papers/blob/master/Co
   ntributing.md]contributing guide for further instructions, though just
   letting me know the title of papers can also be a big contribution to
   us.)

   (Update) You can download all top-100 papers with
   [https://github.com/terryum/awesome-deep-learning-papers/blob/master/fe
   tch_papers.py]this and collect all authors' names with
   [https://github.com/terryum/awesome-deep-learning-papers/blob/master/ge
   t_authors.py]this. Also,
   [https://github.com/terryum/awesome-deep-learning-papers/blob/master/to
   p100papers.bib]bib file for all top-100 papers are available. Thanks,
   doodhwala, [https://github.com/sunshinemyson]Sven and
   [https://github.com/grepinsight]grepinsight!
     * Can anyone contribute the code for obtaining the statistics of the
       authors of Top-100 papers?
