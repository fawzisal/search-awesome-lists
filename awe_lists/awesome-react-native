     We highly recommend integrating Instabug's framework as they
     compiled a lot of great features in their SDK that provides useful
     and rich data with each bug/crash report. They removed the hassle of
     debugging as the SDK automatically attach screenshots, screen
     recordings, device details, network logs and repro-steps with each
     bug report which speeds up development process.
