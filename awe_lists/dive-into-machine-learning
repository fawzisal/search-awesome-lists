Awesome

   Hi there! This guide is for you:
     * You're new to
       [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning]Machine Learning.
     * You know Python. (At least the basics! If you want to learn more
       Python, [https://github.com/hangtwenty/python-is-for-lovers]try
       this)

   I learned Python by hacking first, and getting serious later. I wanted
   to do this with Machine Learning. If this is your style, join me in
   getting a bit ahead of yourself.

   Note: There are several fields within "Data" and Machine Learning is
   just one. It's good to know the context:
   [http://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-Data-Analytics-Dat
   a-Analysis-Data-Mining-Data-Science-Machine-Learning-and-Big-Data-1]Wha
   t is the difference between Data Analytics, Data Analysis, Data Mining,
   Data Science, Machine Learning, and Big Data?

Get your feet wet!

   I suggest you get your feet wet ASAP. You'll boost your confidence.

Tools you'll need

     * [https://www.python.org/]Python. Python 3 is the best option.
     * [http://ipython.org/]IPython and the Jupyter Notebook. (FKA IPython
       and IPython Notebook.)
     * Some scientific computing packages:
          + numpy
          + pandas
          + scikit-learn
          + matplotlib

   You can install Python 3 and all of these packages in a few clicks with
   the [https://www.continuum.io/downloads]Anaconda Python distribution.
   Anaconda is popular in Data Science and Machine Learning communities.

   If you're using Python 2.7, don't worry. You don't have to migrate to
   Python 3 just for this guide. Also, if you're using pip/virtualenv
   instead of Anaconda, that's alright too! And re: installing packages,
   this is a helpful doc:

What just happened?

   You just classified some hand-written digits using
   [http://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html]scikit-learn. Neat huh?

   [http://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html]scikit-learn is the go-to
   library for machine learning in Python.
   [http://scikit-learn.org/stable/testimonials/testimonials.html]It's
   used widely. Machine learning is hard. You'll be glad your tools are
   easy to work with.

   I encourage you to look at the
   [http://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html]scikit-learn homepage and
   spend about 5 minutes looking over the names of the strategies
   (Classification, Regression, etc.), and their applications. Don't click
   through yet! Just get a glimpse of the vocabulary.

Dive in

A Visual Introduction to Machine Learning

   Let's learn a bit more about Machine Learning, and a couple of common
   ideas and concerns. Read
   [http://www.r2d3.us/visual-intro-to-machine-learning-part-1/]"A Visual
   Introduction to Machine Learning, Part 1" by
   [https://twitter.com/stephaniejyee]Stephanie Yee and
   [https://twitter.com/tonyhschu/]Tony Chu.

   [http://www.r2d3.us/visual-intro-to-machine-learning-part-1/]A Visual
   Introduction to Machine Learning, Part 1

   It won't take long. It's a beautiful introduction ... Try not to drool
   too much!

A Few Useful Things to Know about Machine Learning

   OK. Let's dive deeper.

   Read [http://homes.cs.washington.edu/%7Epedrod/papers/cacm12.pdf]"A Few
   Useful Things to Know about Machine Learning" by
   [https://homes.cs.washington.edu/%7Epedrod/]Prof. Pedro Domingos. It's
   densely packed with valuable information, but not opaque. The author
   understands that there's a lot of "black art" and folk wisdom, and they
   invite you in.

   Take your time with this one. Take notes. Don't worry if you don't
   understand it all yet.

   The whole paper is packed with value, but I want to call out two
   points:
     * Data alone is not enough. This is where science meets art in
       machine-learning. Quoting Domingos: "... the need for knowledge in
       learning should not be surprising. Machine learning is not magic;
       it can't get something from nothing. What it does is get more from
       less. Programming, like all engineering, is a lot of work: we have
       to build everything from scratch. Learning is more like farming,
       which lets nature do most of the work. Farmers combine seeds with
       nutrients to grow crops. Learners combine knowledge with data to
       grow programs."
     * More data beats a cleverer algorithm. Listen up, programmers. We
       like cool tools. Resist the temptation to reinvent the wheel, or to
       over-engineer solutions. Your starting point is to
       [http://www.artima.com/intv/simplest3.html]Do the Simplest Thing
       that Could Possibly Work. Quoting Domingos: "Suppose you've
       constructed the best set of features you can, but the classifiers
       you're getting are still not accurate enough. What can you do now?
       There are two main choices: design a better learning algorithm, or
       gather more data. [...] As a rule of thumb, a dumb algorithm with
       lots and lots of data beats a clever one with modest amounts of it.
       (After all, machine learning is all about letting data do the heavy
       lifting.)"

   When you work on a real Machine Learning problem, you should focus your
   efforts on your domain knowledge and data before optimizing your choice
   of algorithms. Prefer to [http://wiki.c2.com/?DoSimpleThings]Do Simple
   Things until you have to increase complexity. You should not rush into
   neural networks because you think they're cool. To improve your model,
   get more data. Then use your knowledge of the problem to
   [https://www.thetalkingmachines.com/episodes/software-and-statistics-ma
   chine-learning]explore and process the data. You should only optimize
   the choice of algorithms after you have gathered enough data, and
   you've processed it well.

   Learning

Just about time for a break...

   Before you take a break, grab some podcasts.

   First, download
   [https://dataskeptic.com/blog/episodes/2018/the-master-algorithm]an
   interview with Prof. Domingos on the Data Skeptic podcast (2018). Prof.
   Domingos wrote
   [http://homes.cs.washington.edu/%7Epedrod/papers/cacm12.pdf]the paper
   we read earlier. You might also start reading his book,
   [https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24612233-the-master-algorithm]The
   Master Algorithm by Prof. Pedro Domingos, a clear and accessible
   overview of machine learning.

   Next, subscribe to more machine learning and data science podcasts!
   These are great, low-effort resources that you can casually learn more
   from. To [https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn]learn
   effectively, listen over time, with plenty of headspace.

       nd-machine-learning-in-meds]"Starting Simple" episode, and listen
       to that soon. It supports what we read from Domingos.
       [http://people.seas.harvard.edu/%7Erpa/]Ryan Adams talks about
       starting simple, as we discussed above. Adams also stresses the
       importance of feature engineering. Feature engineering is an
       exercise of the "knowledge" Domingos writes about. In a later
       episode,
       [https://www.thetalkingmachines.com/episodes/software-and-statistic
       s-machine-learning]they share many concrete tips for feature
       engineering.
     * Then, over time, you can listen to the entire podcast series (start
       from the beginning).

     ... Bayesian ideas have had a big impact in machine learning in the
     past 20 years or so because of the flexibility they provide in
     building structured models of real world phenomena. Algorithmic
     advances and increasing computational resources have made it
     possible to fit rich, highly structured models which were previously
     considered intractable.

     dangerous to think of these quick wins as coming for free. Using the
     framework of technical debt, we note that it is remarkably easy to
     incur massive ongoing maintenance costs at the system level when
     applying machine learning. The goal of this paper is highlight
     several machine learning specific risk factors and design patterns
     to be avoided or refactored where possible. These include boundary
     erosion, entanglement, hidden feedback loops, undeclared consumers,
     data dependencies, changes in the external world, and a variety of

Welcome to the Danger Zone

   So you are dabbling with Machine Learning. You've got Hacking Skills.
   Maybe you've got some "knowledge" in Domingos' sense (some "Substantive
   Expertise" or "Domain Knowledge"). This diagram is modified slightly
   from Drew Conway's "Data Science Venn Diagram." It isn't a perfect fit
   for us, but it may get the point across:

   [http://drewconway.com/zia/2013/3/26/the-data-science-venn-diagram]Drew
   Conway's Data Science Venn Diagram, modified slightly

   Please don't sell yourself as a Machine Learning expert while you're
   still in the Danger Zone. Don't build bad products or publish junk
   science. (Also please
   [https://arstechnica.co.uk/security/2016/02/the-nsas-skynet-program-may
   -be-killing-thousands-of-innocent-people/]don't be evil.) This guide
   can't tell you how you'll know you've "made it" into Machine Learning
   competence ... let alone expertise. It's hard to evaluate proficiency
   without schools or other institutions. This is a common problem for
   self-taught people.

Towards Expertise

   You need practice. [https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10508565]On
   Hacker News, user olympus commented to say you could use competitions
   to practice and evaluate yourself.
   [https://www.kaggle.com/competitions]Kaggle and
   [http://www.chalearn.org/]ChaLearn are hubs for Machine Learning
   competitions. You can find some
   [https://github.com/apeeyush/machine-learning]examples of code for
   popular Kaggle competitions here. For smaller exercises,
   [https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/ai/machine-learning/page/1]try
   HackerRank.

   You also need understanding. You should review what Kaggle competition
   winners say about their solutions, [http://blog.kaggle.com/]for
   example, the "No Free Hunch" blog. These might be over your head at
   first but once you're starting to understand and appreciate these, you
   know you're getting somewhere.

   Competitions and challenges are just one way to practice. You shouldn't
   limit yourself, though - and you should also understand that
   [https://jvns.ca/blog/2014/06/19/machine-learning-isnt-kaggle-competiti
   ons]Machine Learning isn't all about Kaggle competitions.

   Here's a complementary way to practice: do practice studies.
    1. Ask a question. Start your own study. The
       [https://github.com/DataScienceSpecialization/courses/blob/master/0
       1_DataScientistToolbox/03_02_whatIsData/index.Rmd#the-data-is-the-s
       econd-most-important-thing]"most important thing in data science is
       the question" ([https://github.com/jtleek]Dr. Jeff T. Leek). So
       start with a question. Then, find
       [https://github.com/caesar0301/awesome-public-datasets]real data.
       Analyze it. Then ...
    2. Communicate results. When you have a novel finding, reach out for
       peer review.
    3. Fix issues. Learn. Share what you learn.

   And repeat. Re-phrasing this, it fits with the
   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method]scientific method:
   formulate a question (or problem statement), create a hypothesis,
   gather data, analyze the data, and communicate results. (You should
   [http://101.datascience.community/2012/06/27/the-data-scientific-method
   /]watch this video about the scientific method in data science, and/or
   [http://customerthink.com/getting-insights-using-data-science-skills-an
   d-the-scientific-method/]read this article.)

   How can you come up with interesting questions? Here's one way. Every
   Sunday, [https://github.com/caesar0301/awesome-public-datasets]browse
   datasets and write down some questions. Also, sign up for
   [https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural]Data is Plural, a newsletter of
   interesting datasets; look at these, datasets, and write down
   questions. Stay curious. When a question inspires you, start a study.

   This advice, to do practice studies and learn from peer review, is
   based on
   [https://github.com/hangtwenty/dive-into-machine-learning/issues/11#iss
   uecomment-153934120]a conversation with
   [http://www.randalolson.com/]Dr. Randal S. Olson. Here's more advice
   from Olson,
   [https://github.com/hangtwenty/dive-into-machine-learning/issues/11#iss
   uecomment-154135498]quoted with permission:

     I think the best advice is to tell people to always present their
     methods clearly and to avoid over-interpreting their results. Part
     of being an expert is knowing that there's rarely a clear answer,
     especially when you're working with real data.

   As you repeat this process, your practice studies will become more
   scientific, interesting, and focused. The most important part of this
   process is peer review.

Ask for Peer Review

   Here are some communities where you can reach out for peer review:
     * [https://stats.stackexchange.com/]Cross-Validated:
       stats.stackexchange.com
     * [https://reddit.com/r/DataIsBeautiful]/r/DataIsBeautiful

     * [https://reddit.com/r/MachineLearning]/r/MachineLearning
     * [https://news.ycombinator.com/]Hacker News: news.ycombinator.com.
       You'll probably want to submit as "Show HN"

   Post to any of those, and ask for feedback. You'll get feedback. You'll
   learn a ton. As experts review your work you will learn a lot about the
   field. You'll also be practicing a crucial skill: accepting critical
   feedback.

   When I read the feedback on my Pull Requests, first I repeat to myself,
   "I will not get defensive, I will not get defensive, I will not get
   defensive." You may want to do that before you read reviews of your
   Machine Learning work too.
     __________________________________________________________________

Collaborate with Domain Experts!

   Machine Learning can be powerful, but it is not magic.

   Whenever you apply Machine Learning to solve a problem, you are going
   to be working in some specific problem domain. To get good results, you
   or your team will need "substantive expertise" AKA "domain knowledge."
   Learn what you can, for yourself... But you should also collaborate.
   You'll have better results if you collaborate with domain experts.
   (What's a domain expert? See the
   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subject-matter_expert]Wikipedia entry,
   or [http://wiki.c2.com/?DomainExpert]c2 wiki's rather subjective but
   useful blurb.)

A note about Machine Learning and User Experience (UX)

   I couldn't say it better:

     Machine learning won't figure out what problems to solve. If you
     aren't aligned with a human need, you're just going to build a very
     powerful system to address a very small--or perhaps
     nonexistent--problem.

   Quote is from [https://design.google/library/ux-ai/]"The UX of AI" by
   Josh Lovejoy, whole article is a great read!

   Today we are
   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#Applications]surrounded
   by software that utilizes Machine Learning. Often, the results are
   directly user-facing, and intended to enhance UX.

   Before you start working ML into every aspect of your software, you
   should get a better understanding of UX, as well as how ML and UX can
   relate. For some cursory overview,
   [https://www.quora.com/search?q=machine+learning+ux]start with Quora,
   which has some interesting, thoughtful discussions on the subject.
   Then, if you you know a coworker or friend who works in UX, take them
   out for coffee or lunch and pick their brain. I think they'll have
   words of encouragement as well as caution. (Do you know good resources
   on this? Pull requests welcome for all parts of this guide, including
   this section!)

   By no means will that make you an expert in UX, but maybe it'll help
   you know if/when to reach out for help (hint: almost always -- UX is
   really tricky and you should work with experts whenever you can!).

A note about Machine Learning and Security (InfoSec, AppSec)

   There was a great BlackHat webcast on this topic,
   [https://www.blackhat.com/html/webcast/02192015-secure-because-math.htm

   overfitting could be harmless. If you're relying on ML to protect from
   threats, overfitting could be downright dangerous. Check the full

Deep Learning

   In early editions of this guide, there was no specific "Deep Learning"
   section. I omitted it intentionally. I think it is not effective for us
   to jump too far ahead. I also know that if you become an expert in
   traditional Machine Learning, you'll be capable of moving onto advanced
   subjects like Deep Learning, whether or not I've put that in this
   guide. We're just trying to get you started here!

   Maybe this is a way to check your progress: ask yourself, does Deep
   Learning seem like magic? If so, take that as a sign that you aren't
   ready to work with it professionally. Let the fascination motivate you
   to learn more. I have read some argue you can learn Deep Learning in
   isolation; I have read others recommend it's best to master traditional
   Machine Learning first. Why not start with traditional Machine
   Learning, and develop your reasoning and intuition there? You'll only
   have an easier time learning Deep Learning after that. After all of it,
   you'll able to tackle all sorts of interesting problems.

   In any case, when you decide you're ready to dive into Deep Learning,
   here are some helpful resources.

   If you are working with data-intensive applications at all, I'll
   recommend this book:
     * [http://dataintensive.net/]Designing Data-Intensive Applications by
       Martin Kleppman. (You can start reading it online, free, via Safari
       Books.) It's not specific to Machine Learning, but you can bridge
       that gap yourself.

       People like you will do exciting things with TensorFlow. It's a
       framework. Frameworks can help you manage complexity. Just remember
       this rule of thumb: "More data beats a cleverer algorithm"
       (Domingos), no matter how cool your tools are. Also note,
       TensorFlow is not the only machine learning framework of its kind:
