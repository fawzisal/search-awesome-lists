Awesome

     A curated list of useful resources for JavaScript Promises

   Inspired by the [https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome]awesome list
   thing. Not to be confused with other awesome promises like "I promise
   you a million dollars" or "I promise you'll stay fit and never have to
   go to the gym again".

Promises/A+ Implementations (ES6/ES2015 compatible)

Strict Implementations

   These implement no more or less than the es6 spec. They make great
   polyfills and are exceptionally compatible with native promises.
     * [https://github.com/floatdrop/pinkie]pinkie - Ponyfill.
       Node-oriented, but
       [https://github.com/substack/node-browserify]browserifyable.
       Extremely small implementation.
     * [https://github.com/getify/native-promise-only]native-promise-only
       - Polyfill. Browser and node-compatible.
     * [https://github.com/stefanpenner/es6-promise]es6-promise - Opt-in
       polyfill. A strict-spec subset of rsvp.js.
     * [https://github.com/calvinmetcalf/lie]lie - Small, browserifyable
       with an opt-in polyfill.

Implementations with extras

   All of these provide more features than the language yet remain
   compatible. Node + Browsers for all.
     * [https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird]bluebird - Fully
       featured, extremely performant. Long stack traces &
       generator/coroutine support.
     * [https://github.com/briancavalier/creed]creed - Hyper performant &
       full featured like Bluebird, but FP-oriented. Coroutines,
       generators, promises, ES2015 iterables, & fantasy-land spec.
     * [https://github.com/tildeio/rsvp.js/]rsvp.js - Lightweight with a
       few extras. Compatible down to IE6!
     * [https://github.com/kriskowal/q]Q - One of the original
       implementations. Long stack traces and other goodies.
     * [https://github.com/then/promise]then/promise - Small with nodeify,
       denodify and done() additions.
     * [https://github.com/cujojs/when]when.js - Packed with control flow,
       functional, and utility methods.

Fallbacks

     * [https://www.npmjs.com/package/native-or-bluebird]native-or-bluebir
       d - Helps transition to completely native.
     * [https://github.com/floatdrop/pinkie-promise]pinkie-promise - Use
       native, or fall back to pinkie. Great for node library authors.
     * [https://github.com/kevinbeaty/any-promise]any-promise - Loads the
       first available implementation. Safe for browserify.

Convenience Utilities

   Native and strictly spec-compliant promises are awesome for
   compatibility, future-proofness, library authors, and browsers.
   However, libraries like bluebird patch goodies onto the Promise
   constructor and prototype. Solution? tiny modules of course!
