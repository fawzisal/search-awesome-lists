Levels of security problems

    1. regular application

     * always untrusted -> know it
     * suid bit -> mount with nosuid
     * limit available syscall -> seccomp-bpf, grsec
     * leak to another container (bug in namespaces, filesystem) -> user
       namespaces with different uid inside for each container: 1000 in
       container - 14293 and 15398 outside; security modules like selinux
       or apparmor

    2. system services like cron, ssh

     * run as root -> isolate via bastion host or vm
     * using /dev -> "devices" control group
       The following device nodes are created in the container by default.
       The Docker images are also mounted with nodev, which means that
       even if a device node was pre-created in the image, it could not be
       used by processes within the container to talk to the kernel.
       /dev/console,/dev/null,/dev/zero,/dev/full,/dev/tty*,/dev/urandom,/
       dev/random,/dev/fuse
     * root calls -> capabilities (cap_sys_admin warning!)
       Here is the current list of capabilities that Docker uses: chown,
       dac_override, fowner, kill, setgid, setuid, setpcap,
       net_bind_service, net_raw, sys_chroot, mknod, setfcap, and
       audit_write.
       Docker removes several of these capabilities including the
       following:
       CAP_SETPCAP Modify process capabilities
       CAP_SYS_MODULE Insert/Remove kernel modules
       CAP_SYS_RAWIO Modify Kernel Memory
       CAP_SYS_PACCT Configure process accounting
       CAP_SYS_NICE Modify Priority of processes
       CAP_SYS_RESOURCE Override Resource Limits
       CAP_SYS_TIME Modify the system clock
       CAP_SYS_TTY_CONFIG Configure tty devices
       CAP_AUDIT_WRITE Write the audit log
       CAP_AUDIT_CONTROL Configure Audit Subsystem
       CAP_MAC_OVERRIDE Ignore Kernel MAC Policy
       CAP_MAC_ADMIN Configure MAC Configuration
       CAP_SYSLOG Modify Kernel printk behavior
       CAP_NET_ADMIN Configure the network
       CAP_SYS_ADMIN Catch all
       uses /proc, /sys -> remount ro, drop cap_sys_admin; security
       modules like selinux or apparmor; some part of this fs are
       "namespace-aware"
       Docker mounts these file systems into the container as "read-only"
       mount points.
       . /sys
       . /proc/sys
       . /proc/sysrq-trigger
       . /proc/irq
       . /proc/bus
       Copy-on-write file systems
       Docker uses copy-on-write file systems. This means containers can
       use the same file system image as the base for the container. When
       a container writes content to the image, it gets written to a
       container specific file system. This prevents one container from
       seeing the changes of another container even if they wrote to the
       same file system image. Just as important, one container can not
       change the image content to effect the processes in another
       container.
     * uid 0 -> user namespaces, uid 0 mappet to random uid outside

    3. system services like devices, network, filesystems

     * root -> more of services should work on host outside; isolate
       sensitive functions, run as non-privileged context
     * full privileges -> isolate on kernel level

    4. kernel drivers, network stack, security policies

     * absolute privileges -> run it in separate vm

    5. general like immutable infrastructure

     * container is ro
     * write to small separate rw nosuid part

Technologies for security

   Things are better. For example, most modern container technologies can
   make use of Linux's built-in security tools such as:
   [http://wiki.apparmor.net/index.php/Main_Page]AppArmor,
   [http://selinuxproject.org/page/Main_Page]SELinux and
   [http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/seccomp.2.html]Seccomp policies;
   [https://grsecurity.net/]Grsecurity;
   [https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux
   /6/html/Resource_Management_Guide/ch01.html]Control groups (cgroups);
   [http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/namespaces.7.html]Kernel
   namespaces
   [http://www.itworld.com/article/2920349/security/for-containers-securit
   y-is-problem-1.html]src

   Sure, you're deploying seccomp, but you can't use selinux inside your
   container, because the policy isn't per-namespace (?? lxc uses
   apparmore for each container...)
   [http://selinuxproject.org/page/SVirt]sVirt - selinux for kvm
   [https://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/33170.html]src

   Major kernel subsystems are not namespaced like:
     * SELinux
     * Cgroups
     * file systems under /sys
     * /proc/sys, /proc/sysrq-trigger, /proc/irq, /proc/bus

   Devices are not namespaced:
     * /dev/mem
     * /dev/sd* file system devices
     * kernel modules

   If you can communicate or attack one of these as a privileged process,
   you can own the system.

       containers and microservices can be a little overwhelming, to say
       the least. We thought we might be able to help: welcome to the

       This page is an attempt to document the ins and outs of containers
       on Linux. This is not just restricted to programmers looking to
       implement containers or use container like features in their own
       code but also Sysadmins and Users who want to get more of a handle
       on how containers work 'under the hood'.
