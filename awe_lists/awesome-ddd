     A curated list of Domain-Driven Design (DDD), Command Query
     Responsibility Segregation (CQRS), Event Sourcing, and Event
     Storming resources.

   Check out my [https://buildplease.com/]blog and
   [https://buildplease.com/pages/dddweekly/]weekly DDD newsletter or say
   hi on [https://twitter.com/heynickc]Twitter!

   [https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design]Domain-Driven
   Design (DDD) is an approach to software development for complex needs
   by connecting the implementation to an evolving model. The premise of
   Domain-Driven Design is the following:
     * placing the project's primary focus on the core domain and domain
       logic
     * basing complex designs on a model of the domain
     * initiating a creative collaboration between technical and domain
       experts to iteratively refine a conceptual model that addresses
       particular domain problems

   The term was coined by Eric Evans in his book of the same title.

   [http://codebetter.com/gregyoung/2010/02/16/cqrs-task-based-uis-event-s
   ourcing-agh/]Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) is simply
   the creation of two objects where there was previously only one. The
   separation occurs based upon whether the methods are a command or a
   query (the same definition that is used by Meyer in Command and Query
   Separation, a command is any method that mutates state and a query is
   any method that returns a value).

   [http://www.martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html]Event Sourcing
   the fundamental idea of Event Sourcing is that of ensuring every change
   to the state of an application is captured in an event object, and that
   these event objects are themselves stored in the sequence they were
   applied for the same lifetime as the application state itself.

   [https://ziobrando.blogspot.com/2013/11/introducing-event-storming.html
   ]Event Storming is a workshop format for quickly exploring complex
   business domains.
