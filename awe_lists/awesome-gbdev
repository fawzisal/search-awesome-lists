Disambiguation

   Although this documentation is focused on the original (1989) Game Boy
   (DMG), the Game Boy Color (GBC) and Super Game Boy (SGB) are very
   similar systems, with few important distinctions, such as:
     * Different hardware specifications
     * Specific hardware and software features
     * Specific registers
     * Specific bugs and exploitable behaviours

   If you aim to develop your software for SGB or GBC, or you want to know
   how it runs on the others system, you may want to take advantage and
   adapt to these differences, check the
   [file://localhost/Users/admin/Pros/sh/awesome/awe_raw/awesome-gbdev#gam
   e-boy-color]Game Boy Color category and look for specific references to
   GBC/CGB and SGB in the documentation.
