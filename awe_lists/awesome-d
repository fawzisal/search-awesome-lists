Awesome

   =========

   A curated list of awesome D frameworks, libraries and software.
   Inspired by [https://github.com/vinta/awesome-python]awesome-python.

   I created this list so that when I needed something in the future, it
   would be easy to find. Most of the documents and links are collected
   from the [http://forum.dlang.org/]D forum, the
   [http://wiki.dlang.org/]D wiki, and the [http://code.dlang.org/]D
   package repository. Exploring GitHub also helps as many of the libs are
   hosted there.

   If you know an interesting lib/app in D, please tell me by issue or a
   pull request :-).
