Awesome

     A curated list of testing software, extensions and resources

Foreword

   This is intended to be a curation of resources for the new among the
   software testing community. It is not tailored to a specific area
   (Usability/Performance) or role (Automation/Management). The idea is
   that you could hand this list to a CS graduate and it would greatly
   improve their testing skills, efficiency and overall breadth of
   knowledge. Note that this is for all areas of software testing after
   the code in question is written (no unit tests/static analysis!).

   Finally, I'm sure everyone who reads this list has one thing they want
   to add. Please read the
   [https://github.com/TheJambo/awesome-testing/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.m
   d]How to Contribute page and add to the list. :)
