Web Apps (frontend only)
     __________________________________________________________________

CircleCI

     * clojurescript, om, react
     * Eclipse Public License

     CircleCI provides a continuous integration and deployment platform.
     The frontend is an impressive example of a large application built
     with the immutable data structures of clojurescript. The frontend
     integrates with pusher, intercom, d3, and google analytics and has a
     great example of navigation routing and communication via real-time
     events, websockets, and backend API servers. Its test suite is not
     that extensive but does provide a good example of how to test
     clojurescript/om apps using karma.

Precursor App

     * clojurescript, om, react
     * Eclipse Public License

     Precursor is a highly interactive prototyping webapp. Its frontend
     is built from the ground up with clojurescript. The project has a
     simple enough routing and event passing system such that newer
     clojurescript developers could easily understand how routing in
     clojurescript applications can work. It is also full of many
     examples of how to build a component based frontend architecture
     that is part of an interactive graphics application i.e. where many
     components manipulate the HTML5 canvas or work with HTML5 APIs.

The Guardian

     * play2, scala, node
     * Apache 2.0 License

     The guardian is a news site with subscriptions, sign in, search, an
     admin interface and a series of middleman scala apps that handle
     communication between the static frontends and backend APIs. Its
     very fast and has a comprehensive test suite plus great examples of
     how to optimize large traditional websites for speed.

Web Apps (fullstack)
     __________________________________________________________________

Ghost

     * node, express, ember
     * MIT License

     Ghost provides a simple publishing platform for bloggers. The code
     contains an emberjs client and node server backend that handle
     authorization, role management, tagging, blog posting, data
     persistence, and most things you'd expect from a quality blogging
     platform. The only thing that Ghost doesn't handle is i18n. It also
     contains a comprehensive test suite with both integration and unit
     tests that hit the whole ember/node stack.

Gitlab

     * ruby, rails, coffescript, redis, sidekiq,
     * MIT License

     Gitlab is a code collaboration tool. It is used by more than 100,000
     organizations. It has just about everything you could imagine in a
     webapp, user management, user roles, OAuth, i18n, many modules
     designed for integrating with third-parties, deep git integration,
     and an extensive asynchronous task system using Sidekiq. It has an
     exemplary test suite using cucumber and rspec.

Discourse

     * ruby, rails, ember
     * GPLv2 License

     Discourse is a discussion platform or a modern take on the web
     forum. It has a very modular system built on top of rails and
     contains great examples of how to build an interactive frontend in
     ember within a rails application. It has an admin interface,
     signup/sign-in with Oauth for Google, Facebook, Twitter, Yahoo, and
     Github. It has extensive i18n, real time notifications, a plugin
     ecosystem, is SEO optimized, and is designed for tablet and mobile
     devices.

Reddit

     * python, pylons, node, react, rabbitmq, postgresql
     * Common Public Attribution License Version 1.0

     Reddit is a news platform for what's new and popular on the web. It
     is built in python and integrates with a lot of third party
     services: rabbitmq, memcached, cassandra, solr, and postgresql to
     name a few. The code provides a good example of a large pylons
     project and shines when it comes to the code that integrates with
     many other services.

Taiga

     * python3, django, coffeescript, angular
     * GNU Affero License

     Taiga is a project management tool. It is an incredible example of a
     modular architecture. Its interface is clean, very well-designed,
     responsive, and fast, and the modern backend code written in python3
     is a great example of a well written django app. It also has an
     extensive test suite with both integration and unit tests using
     pytest.

Travis CI

     * ruby, rails, sinatra, rabbitmq, ember
     * MIT License

     Travis CI is a continutous integration and deployment system. What's
     great about Travis is its modular architecture, every component of
     this large distributed system is split up by its main function. From
     worker management, rails backend, emberjs frontend to yaml
     configuration parser, each is split up into there own repositories.

Desktop Apps
     __________________________________________________________________

Blender

     * c, c++, python
     * GPLv2 License

     Blender is 3D Graphic Software that can visually compete with Maya
     and 3DS Max. The end product is an amazing example of a
     cross-platform 3D Tooling piece of software. It is a very mature
     project having been in development since 1994. It has an embedded
     python scripting engine, a game logic engine and is loaded with
     implementations of 3d manipulation, rendering, and compositing
     algorithms.

Atom

     * coffeescript, electron, node
     * MIT License

     Atom is a hackable text editor. Its built on top of electron and is
     a good example of integrating libchromium, nodejs, and web
     technologies into a cross-platform runnable binary. It also contains
     an exemplary test suite for electron apps.

Mobile Apps

Games
     __________________________________________________________________

0ad

     * c++, python
     * GPLv2 License

     0 A.D is a cross-platform real-time strategy game of ancient
     warfare. Every aspect of the game's implementation is modern and
     impressive - from the AI to the graphics. It also has an embedded
     SpiderMonkey scripting engine, which is a great example for adding
     js scriptability to an existing cpp project.

Hedgewars

     * c, c++, pascal, haskell
     * GPLv2 License

     Hedgewars is a 2D turn-based strategy game like worms but with
     hedgehogs. Its graphics, animation, and gameplay can compete with
     worms on every level. The game server is an impressive real-world
     example of Haskell and the frontend provides a clean interface
     between QT and the backend game.

Wesnoth

     * c, c++, lua
     * GPLv2 License

     The Battle for Wesnoth is a turn-based tactical strategy game with a
     high fantasy theme. It features single player and online multiplayer
     combat. Its GUI and gameplay graphics are impressive as well as its
     multi-platform support (it even builds on NaCL). It has clean,
     well-coded examples of pretty much everything a game developer would
     want to know, from a an embedded lua scripting engine, to a dialog
     and GUI system, to a c++ test suite and cross-platform builds.
